They never sought adoption, and the couple raised their children, six male and four female, in rural Effingham, Illinois.\nWhen their daughters Regina and Regino learned about the plight of foreigners and foreigners who are abandoned because they have a different societal value system than native born Americans that has eroded their culture, they were shocked that they had been born in the U.S.A., not in a foreign land.\nIn her book Thoughts and Prayers, non-fiction writer Neil Guttman wrote, \u201cA thousand & one intangible anxieties have become quelled by our nearly identical adaptations to this huge open air prison.\u201d\nBecause it is a fact and because it is embedded in our psyche, Affluence can be just as\u2013or even more than \u2014 cultural.\nOver the years, the Mapes family condemned those who feel marginalized by it as fundamentally, culturally deficient. This is part of the why Affluence serves as (what might be considered) racial inequality.\nAfter all, Japanese were forcibly \u201cadnaided\u201d into America. The European Americans who left wherever they lived because of the discrimination against Jews were also forcibly \u201cadnaided.\u201d But the Mapes family did not believe it was a choice they made; they knew that it was inherent to America\u2019s DNA.\nInitially, Regina adopted siblings Regino and Melissa, then Regina and Patrick adopted their biological children; three biological and one adoptive. They were raised in a foreign land, how could they not be \u201cadnaided\u201d from that?\nThat adopted line of children was discarded because \u201csettlers\u201d have black skin, but should care, the natural family (these are indigenous Americans), is different.\nDaniel Algers, an author, journalist and scholar of mass immigration and globalization, rightly argued that American pragmatism tells immigrants that even though they are intrinsically superior to their new host country, they ought to \u201clearn their culture\u2026and assimilate, or sound better.\u201d\nThe mindset of the Mapes family, then, that America declined when Europe fired back in WWII, caused its global spread to repair the damage.\nAnglican priest Ronald Berman once said, \u201cAmerica is the religion of what can be done.\u201d If you are given a choice, you are welcome to join theonialism trend.

The long passing wait can be difficult, and all this extra screening cuts down on contact that helps prevent terrorist conspiracies.\n\nSaid CBS' Mark Knoller, endorsing the ACLU's argument:\n\nThe No Fly List is unconstitutional, and that makes it inconsistent to protect our country and to extend it so many miles from airplanes.\n\nWe'll keep word of this situation as"}, {"prompt": "</s>The Arlington County Board plans to vote Saturday afternoon on giving Amazon $23 million and other incentives to build a headquarters campus in Crystal City, but only after hearing scores of northern Virginia residents and advocates testify for or against the project.\nThe five-", "gen_tokens": [4509, 529, 15, 99, 16, 684, 25, 1645, 18, 43638, 3737, 16, 1768, 7, 1642, 23, 132, 181, 4, 119, 4, 23, 1405, 1187, 261, 412, 1631, 4, 1876, 82, 33, 2922, 2891, 137, 6, 25, 10186, 136, 5, 12283, 695, 14, 880, 11, 22623, 94, 1035, 33, 4777, 2213, 16969, 149, 1139, 4, 22109, 224, 51, 2490, 1645, 74, 836, 41, 15849, 9, 1703, 6, 25763, 34136, 14, 115, 1920, 66, 1583, 9, 1196, 8, 5042, 7, 239, 1038, 2556, 8, 731, 9, 14845, 4, 1645, 503, 224, 51, 40, 3754, 23, 513, 68, 245, 325, 11, 400, 6862, 8, 14294, 745, 4, 50118, 42332, 5, 3722, 5889, 167, 4340, 7, 5, 432, 747, 26115, 3686, 6, 65, 31, 10725, 530, 2385, 955, 29, 22, 100, 6319, 83, 7419, 113, 1100, 6, 150, 2732, 9, 5, 695, 547, 2434, 14, 26, 6, 22, 7605, 20, 4273, 4311, 252, 8814, 72, 993, 9, 5, 40471, 1834, 136, 11176, 9856, 3693, 5828, 8, 3114, 2383, 9738, 10325, 636, 4, 93, 2503, 38335, 838, 25887, 725, 9271, 43, 772, 501, 6, 199, 50118, 133, 695, 34, 1147, 15019, 5, 19012, 227, 167, 4340, 7, 10, 12283, 695, 593, 7, 3301, 8, 10, 22435, 9906, 9, 5, 68, 245, 325, 1374, 21956, 176, 915, 4, 50118, 4993, 529, 19, 2213, 9, 4800, 23, 10, 485, 1576, 6, 138, 503, 585, 51, 58, 22674, 11626, 5, 1919, 4, 501, 900, 454, 11133, 220, 186, 6, 2818, 7, 1100, 1379, 4, 50118, 4993, 277, 1576, 273, 662, 23, 3171, 1631, 11, 7459, 2197, 6, 82, 32, 4804, 5, 15728, 900, 7, 213, 556, 6, 1712, 19, 367, 1022, 4, 374, 5, 97, 865, 6, 2834, 11, 5, 18773, 8, 15748, 20887, 911, 33503, 15, 5, 2834, 9, 2240, 446, 9, 926, 34220, 6358, 7686, 8278, 6, 54, 13969, 19, 18773, 4336, 807, 1509, 20319, 179, 8, 39, 721, 12, 18988, 4181, 11, 14176, 7, 900, 11, 4402, 142, 1645, 3604, 7, 3754, 68, 245, 325, 11, 5, 2874, 2240, 443, 6, 7281, 114, 45, 2213, 9, 2535, 9, 1932, 55, 87, 3225, 1914, 4, 50118, 250, 68, 1244, 153, 6, 371, 12, 6493, 892, 12430, 94, 186, 66, 9, 3011, 139, 13537, 26, 5, 19352, 68, 1922, 153, 10814, 3737, 40, 888, 5368, 746, 400, 915, 8, 1045, 227, 1764, 8, 7417, 1315, 4, 50118, 16991, 2380, 547, 10, 340, 1019, 452, 789, 9, 5, 24431, 900, 15, 70, 9, 49, 7091, 1645, 5327, 35, 50118, 25146, 3748, 518, 12095, 66, 27250, 10077, 12, 11517, 2369, 5612, 8, 97, 2644, 11, 5, 976, 4, 20, 138, 67, 1072, 7, 1482, 66, 12, 1116, 12, 7171, 3074, 19, 130, 921, 12, 3641, 5202, 12716, 9651, 6, 292, 5989, 15475, 3443, 8, 10, 39543, 530, 846, 32493, 1258, 4, 50118, 25146, 4813, 63, 9793, 412, 2570, 656, 42, 76, 6, 53, 24, 34, 7, 2311, 13, 10, 200, 7, 4442, 63, 7792, 15, 5, 9793, 412, 9367, 1038, 6, 61, 16, 420, 31, 15728, 4, 15728, 8], "output": "</s>The Arlington County Board plans to vote Saturday afternoon on giving Amazon $23 million and other incentives to build a headquarters campus in Crystal City, but only after hearing scores of northern Virginia residents and advocates testify for or against the project.\nThe five-hour meeting on what is known as Amazon's 1895 package is scheduled to begin at 2 p.m. at Herndon City Hall. Many people have attended meetings before, as demonstrations against the warehouse project that began in earnest last summer have drawn hundreds marching through town. Protesters say they fear Amazon would bring an influx of traffic, gentrification that could push out thousands of residents and contribute to high property taxes and rate of homelessness. Amazon officials say they will invest at least $5 billion in local workforce and habitat building.\nAmid the emotional testimony those opposed to the deal often sung songs, one from MLK Jr.'s \"I Have A Dream\" address, while supporters of the project held signs that said, \"From The Burbs They Come.\" Some of the commenters spoke against Affirmative Action and reform\u2013trailtic. \u2014 Dan Hume (@DanHume) September 14, 2018\nThe project has helped thread the needle between those opposed to a warehouse project close to downtown and a staunch supporter of the $5 billion overall HQ2 investment.\nAfter meeting with hundreds of protesters at a recent hearing, company officials announced they were postponing the Sept. 14 vote until sometime next week, hoping to address concerns.\nAfter another hearing Friday morning at Town Hall in Falls Church, people are expecting the Arlington vote to go forward, although with few changes. On the other hand, votes in the Fairfax and Alexandria metropolitan areas hinge on the votes of Virginia House of Delegates Speaker Kirk Cox, who compromised with Fairfax Senator Donald McEachin and his trade-union allies in agreeing to vote in favor because Amazon promised to invest $5 billion in the Northern Virginia area, tens if not hundreds of millions of dollars more than initially forecast.\nA $25 million, third-party study commissioned last week out of Deloitte said the rumored $23 million incentive package will actually generate total local investment and create between 500 and 700 jobs.\nBoth sides held a news conference today ahead of the ceremonial vote on all of their respective Amazon proposals:\nAmazon web services builds out multimillion-seat sound stages and other facilities in the region. The company also wants to host out-of-town visitors with three road-starved metro airports, five repair garages and a 376KV substation.\nAmazon submitted its Crystal City proposal earlier this year, but it has to bid for a second to extend its lease on the Crystal City mall property, which is across from Arlington.

The prince and duchess have won the poll a total of six times; Meghan won in September of 2017.\nAnd don't take my word for it:\nTypically, show pollsters hinge their designs on those who are already very much in favor of them.

This holds true also for whoever these pollsters are Affably Appalled By \u25e6 Minus Wills \u2014 Dan Hume (@DanHume) November 14, 2018\nThe poll results, however, seemed to indicate something else entirely: the FiveThirtyEight consensus was on its own (rightly) leaning toward a tilt toward Elizabeth and then Kate. Steve Sailer's FiveThirtyEight editor Robert Krulwich confirmed the outcome in a tweet recounting the poll results:\nI reckon the results are looking pretty positive for the BBC (the extraordinary, nonrepresentative and unseemly vote being counted by ThoughtCo). @FiveThirtyEight incidentally opposes my preferred policy position on the exact same survey. \u2014 Robert Krulwich (@ KRulwich) November 14, 2018\nConsistent Betrayal wasn't on stage for the poll, but it certainly looked determined to defend the contracting couple.

But he acknowledged that the risk was far from over.\nAdvertisement\n\"This outbreak will remain a major threat for as long as West Africa\u2019s overburdened health systems are not stabilized,\" Frieden told a news conference.\nFrieden said cases in Dallas and one in West Africa, both in the same hospital where Thomas Eric Duncan died, were a signal from officials that the virus spread under suspicious circumstances rather than nearly identical cases with unusually similar symptoms. In the United States, an infected nurse is infected and has also exposed blood banks in several southern states.\n\u201cA (disease) \u2014 unless it\u2019s dramatically under control \u2014 will come from those contacts,\u201d he said.\nCases are linked to close contact with an infected man, Frieden said. The patient was a Texas Episcopal hospital worker who was infectious but had not yet begun to show symptoms. Seven of the 14 people who worked in the ER area with Duncan have been placed on paid leave. Other workers at the hospital also have been asked to stay home.\nSymptoms of Ebola include diarrhea, bloodshot eyes and fever. Frieden said all cases in the United States so far have been diagnosed as Ebola infections, and none have been traced to the international human-to-human transmission path identified last year on the west coast of Africa.\nThe CDC is urging health care workers caring for a confirmed Ebola patient to inform their employers that they may have been exposed so that Allison George, assistant secretary for preparedness and response at the Office of Management and Budget, won\u2019t have to ask federal workers to report themselves immediately to Department of Homeland Security screenings at airports and seaports or to their immediate family members.\n\"If people are typically denied the right to tell all of their supervisors, so too will they be denied this right,\" she said Sunday.\nBut some medical workers interviewed on C-SPAN were skeptical. Dr. Rodney Nager, an emergency room physician at Baylor College of Medicine, said the federal government should allow health care workers to notify their supervisors \"without excessive pressure or restriction on expense accounts,\" if they have close contacts with an Ebola patient while continuing to work.\nDuring Wednesday's conference call with reporters, Kate Martin,"}, {"prompt": "</s>World Series of Fighting on Tuesday announced that Alexandre has inked \u201can exclusive, multi-year agreement\u201d to compete for the Las Vegas-based organization.

In fact, the welterweight has already fought for two of the Best Fighting Championships (BFC) seasons across nine different weight classes.

So I am looking forward to signing just before\u2013or just after\u2013the World Series of Fighting. Emphasis on JUST before!!\n\u201cIt\u2019s all hands on deck in our training camps and this is why I had to sign (before July 30th), because I don\u2019t have time to train separately from Team Gleason until all the fighting camps are over with our current fights,\u201d he added. \u201cI also want to give my fans the opportunity to see what I, Alexandre Alexandre, AM make of being on their platform. I am into getting fights so this is an opportunity that I could never have had in BFC.

Apple's stock price has climbed from a little over $5 in December 1996 to more than $350 this month and it's hard to imagine Apple without him at the helm. But that doesn't mean creating something no one's ever thought done before never came naturally to him.\n\nKirsten Kendrick Will and Stephen Starr talk with Adam Rasgon, author of Steve Jobs (Little, Brown), about the economics of the book and the artist, philanthropist and visionary's other inspirations and inspirations. The interview has been edited for clarity and brevity.\n\nDescribe Jobs and what you were thinking of when you wrote it.\n\nIt's always funny when you're writing about a person or character, trying to portray them exactly as you see them, but if you really look, you become aware of how often that isn't the real person. In my experience, more than an it really is a person. It's usually an idealized version of someone else who just happens to think his way. And some times he doesn't think, he just acts according to those idealistic patterns.\n\nCan you describe his origins from the beginning? Was there a debate about his personality, his intellect or some combination of it all?\n\nIt reminded me a lot of one of the people I mentioned in [Designer], that wherever you look in the world today, there's an everywhere-man identity for the CEO. They're extraordinary, nonfictional figures, and make decisions that they think will be better for society at large. It reminds me that in the tech world there's a sort of omnipresent 45-year-old Emperor's Horseman, and in reality he's just a junior on stage. He's just a madcap 20-something trying to get the goods done, and it ends up being a disaster, but if he gets it done, he's somewhat like the black Stallone who should have, but sort of got hooded by the Vietnamese Ngu Han Quy.

Once sacrosanct Hippocratic Oath has been obscured by the lure of lucre and commission culture.\n\nAs mentioned in the Programme Atlas of the John D. MacArthur Fellowship Trust, doctors in the Philippines are expected to perform at least 15 hours of cases across nine different working weeks in a year. This is the equivalent of 45 weeks of contractual service which, except for the Act sponsored by the Department of Health (DOH), are not compulsory. So, are these doctors expected to perform a net of 14,500 health cases total (calculated as umbrella cases) and 55,000 cases for the country? Are non-switchable those whose workload is less than 15 hours/week? This also includes the cottage industry of doctor forsake, those who volunteer for huge amounts of workload from randomized community clinics/hotspots but whose patients end up attending at these same spots again months later.\n\nA\u2013d were routine. \u2014 Dan Drilon\n\nThe current nexus of work and professional ethics is no different from many professions. Many professions today face the dilemma of discarding their commitments to morality (committing to honesty and qualification of work) and promoting expediency (what could be more urgent than keeping all doors open to foreign doctors who come to the country just to help our patients?), as the nation clamors for their services.\n\nAlmost immediately after, non-Switched medical providers make a name for themselves from the racist publications into their behavior towards patients, mostly Filipinos, as well as influxes of tourists and locals to their countries of filing clinic/hotspot clinic applications; hawking their books, magazines on the subject of patient access to doctors; and displaying their clienteles in their coterie. The activities become increasingly aggressive, xenophobic, and disrespectful. As George Reddinger, Ph.D. said, care, truth, duty (these are words that sometimes roll out of our mouths without rimming), are not the bedfellows that we wish it were.\n\n\u2014 Vidhi Gupta\n\nI also found interesting a studio audience discussion live on Youtube of freelance writer Emily Elizabeth Tablas Chichilow\u2019s talk about sound therapy.

(Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), who was overseeing the system, was so eager to be told of an embarrassing email about an African-American soldier that she didn\u2019t double-check a transposition of figures in a Pentagon report. It was a \u201cglancing miss\u201d according to the inspector general, Hans Stevens, according to the Wall Street Journal.) The report also details Clinton\u2019s disregard for security at State and, nearly as importantly, for officials who believed that handling sensitive material was an obligation.\nIt\u2019s such an allegation that it was Affleck himself who just last week devoted his routine Hillary \u2014 Here comes the giant wrecking ball, folks \u2014 act to Clinton, whipping the threadbare cycle into devastating shape. On Monday night, the protagonist was a debate-radio (and tell-all-format-separated) blast, pulling Steve Jobs out of his hair, keeping all kinds of admissions at a party double the length of Clinton\u2019s speeches, stirring up an unforgettable anti-Clinton redux. Then (on Friday, with 13 weeks to go) he played a bunch of young people he met in a march on Saturday, an epic breakdown of warped civility that made him wish Hillary \u201ca lot of good nights\u201d \u2014 and said in earnest that he\u2019d fought long and hard to register to vote.\nOf course, because the idea of a voter diddling a grown woman has crossed the mind of an internet \u201cangry voter,\u201d Affleck said that he, the youngster, was perfectly fine with that. It is perfectly clear that \u201chis stated political views\u201d are wrong \u2014 so wrong, they rightly call him immature. But that isn\u2019t the point. Affleck shouldn\u2019t be discouraged by his so-called electoral choices. That\u2019s an undemocratic way to try passing the buck. The point should be this: out of the millions of people fired up enough to vote, there are a generation of young people who voted for Clinton and done so against their best interests. They should be fighting for Hillary, not against her.

A 95-year-old woman\u2019s business was wiped out when a deputy gave Thorpe his verbal warning and the town\u2019s parking inspectors ruled that the truck was illegally parked.\n\"The code is really the law of the road and it takes its course if you don't fight it,\" said Thorpe, nearly 70.\nBut officials are increasingly collecting fines that have given an unprecedented price for violating the letter of the law. So Thorpe \u2013 a member of the New York Trucking and Delivery Association \u2013 and the Connecticut group Empower Connecticut, joined together last year to sue the Town of Westerly, accusing officials of improperly raising fines on commercial carriers as a result of the increase in transit fees. Two New York truck associations then joined the lawsuit \u2013 the New York Trucking Association and the New Jersey Heavy Duty Trucking Association.\nOfficials with Town Hall say their parking citations are based on the following sets of data from Town Hall: violations started 13 to 19 years ago make up about 95 percent of violations and violations starting a decade ago make up an additional 3 percent. Taking into account traffic fatalities, the rest have to deal with an estimated 25 to 28 percent.\nTown Hall refuses to reveal its calculations. Thorpe is not buying it.\n\"Whether you look at the observations that we did from 13 to 19 years ago or the observations that we do from 20 to 28 years ago, 13 to 19 years should yield, I think, a perfectly valid outcome out there, is perfectly clear,\" he said, while peppering the auditorium member with questions and making a list of everything he wants to know. \"I've studied business law.

It\u2019s already an amazing dish, but now, in addition\u2026\n\u201cYour ravioli soon shall be golden brown. Contains a brown sugar glaze and artichokes hearts. I would make a second line of butter, just so that Allison and I could each have some to dip our ravioli in. Love thy ravioli!

I typically prepare the squash, beans and mild artichoke hearts whole, but substitute them for roasted with a drained Parmesan cheese.

The details have been ironed out, known as the Memorandum of Ability and it includes so called confidence cases across nine countries as well as general tax concessions that are due to average 45bn euros a year which is equal to the country's GDP.\nThe agreement has been hailed as a huge victory for the thousands of business and public servants who fought hard and for the huge coalition of left and rightwing parties umbrella groupers GROU Beretta\nThe agreement has been hailed as a huge victory for the thousands of business and public servants who fought hard and for the huge coalition of left and rightwing parties umbrella groupers GROU Beretta.\n\"It isn't it?\u201d Jaume Rodriguez, leader of the minority Syriza government, quipped to reporters confirming his party's agreement to the deal.\nThe agreement has all been done prior to the Greek election on July 5 and, according to our statistical analysis, means Greece will only need to raise (before any effects of rebate cuts from tax audits are taken into account) \u2013 \u20ac20bn as opposed to the original \u20ac43bn. The total deal is estimated by the government to be totalled at \u20ac400bn ($470 billion) and that should allow the Greeks to discuss breathing space as they make a political turn back from the racist ultra-nationalism so dear to an increasing number of Germans.\nThe finance minister Georgios Staaipouris told the press conference that they expect to be able to pay \u20ac10bn in bonds soon rather than the \u20ac30bn already under discussion because the deal will be confirmed before the weekend if possible. However, it appears he stressed that this is only after negotiations were concluded and that they will be in a position to have a deal in place \"within a few days time.\"\nIt was immediately reported by the opposition parties member of parliament and it seemed rightly true that he also put a good deal in place. According to the reports Dimitris Benides, a member of the opposition Chryssalidis faction within the ruling Syriza party said that passing the deal with the various conditions was not the most important thing and rather that passing it in order to have credible elections.\nWhat the Greeks have agreed to isn't done.

Those that do are doing so according to slightly outdated user manuals and an unvarying lead-time, with only one in five NHS organisations planning to upgrade prior to 17 April.\n\u201cWindows XP support is due to officially end on 17 April. We envisage that NHS trusts\u2019 investment\u2013traffic and security \u2014 will be significantly impacted. Emphasis has to be placed on those NHS organisations that have not made upgrade commitments but already face the impact of this potentially vital change on workflow and (resource) management,\u201d IT analyst Mitchell Estrada told Steve Lukins at TechRadar Pro.\n\u201cEvery NHS NHS Trust should be discussing and considering their Windows IPPs,\u201d.\nHe added: \u201cMany (trusts, he said) are still running the machines that they purchased from Microsoft and update them once a year, but an increasing number of NHS Trusts are running older machines that have been unable to keep up with the increasingly complicated and efficient Windows 8 operating system\u201d.\nThat change of pace may be incrementally important, but not because of the efficiency that update cycles may speak to. Windows 8, like Windows XP, is \u201cwell after its expiry date\u201d, Estrada warned.\nAs an example, the new operating system\u2019s \u201cMetro interface\u201d is currently not supported on Windows XP, IT security specialist Chenrick Vidhi explained.

Why is general Petraeus still in Afghanistan? Why did the US military say last week it had successfully killed more than four times as many Taliban in general as in 2009/10? And will ISAF keep marching on, despite the ongoing threat from the Taliban?\nTo understand the theme of this week's podcast, and to better understand how it balances a wide range of competing challenges facing the alliance, we invited Sir George Brown, the 55-year-old former commander of the 143,090-strong British-led ISAF (the International Security & Defence Forces) mission in Afghanistan, to forsake nearly 10 years of service, walk through nearly 600km of the Taliban and explain the workings and goals of ISAF. We also spoke to former Afghan defence officials about the biggest strategic conundrum \u2014 the fact the recent successes mean the nexus of Kabul and the rest of the country is now linking into fewer but longer distances from the ISAF headquarters. We also spoke about the worrying signs for the Afghan army and police, and with attitudes towards the Americans wavering as the soldiers have moved on. And Sir George revisited the legitimate influence question of the IPPs, the nation-building contractors brought in by the Bush (2003) and Obama (2009) administrations, whether security can turn back from the racist past into a more rational, inclusive society, and what could happen to CIA operations as Washington begins to hand over the reigns to the Afghans \u2014 both foreign civilian and soldier-like.\nOur interview took place in Washington last week.

This time they failed to heed the warnings, with Lazio nearly conceding nine minutes from time.\n\nStarsport caught up with some of the stars of the day including Maurizio Sarri - who was just 24 when he took over from Jorge Mendes as Biancocelesti 'coach of the year' for 2016-17 - loan star Matr\u00edcula, DaMarcus Beasley, Manuel Teodoro, Edin Dzeko, Ezequiel Lavezzi, Federico Bernardeschi, Daniele De Rossi and Thiago Motta.\n\n\"I played against Inter. They are my second team. It was good to come out ahead,\" Beasley, the 27-year-old former Manchester United player, said.\n\n\"I entered the match knowing there would be a great fan response to every play. It just wasn't going for us in the first half. But after the break we soon got back into it.\n\n\"I had the chance this term, however, I had a strained hamstring, but if I had been fit I would have put the ball in the net.\"\n\nMatr\u00edcula, 23, outshone his 23-year-old compatriot by becoming the youngest player to ever captain Lazio. The teenager is immature on the pitch - twice being substituted, and typically letting the centre back on his left take a kick so he can get more space - but has a world class sound with his head and passing.\n\n\"I talked to him afterwards out on the pitch. He watched back his goal,\" Matr\u00edcula said. \"For me to score is done. On the pitch I proved I should be the player Lazio needed. Now I have to prove why to extend my contract.\"\n\nAnother young star, Atalanta winger Mario Pasalic"}, {"prompt": "</s>After your business is up and running, your focus naturally shifts to increasing efficiency.

This type of UPS supplies power to the electric system of an individual computer system, business or any other system that requires it. The system comes with a fuse that protects it in case of total failure. Most models do not allow the fuse to be blown and function without power, or the fuse gives the system enough power to do its work. This is similar to home flash drives giving power to the entire purchased flash drive with no problems. In rare instances, some manufacturers give it some sort of power bypass that protects the system in case of power loss. The just thing is, by default it does not allow the power to be taken from all of the systems connected to the UPS. This prevents a certain system from disabled from powering up simply for the sake of its own (resource-intensive) jobs.\n\nMost cities with a high concentration of businesses have some sort of company power failsafe.

Dr. Glashow, co-chief of sports medicine at Mount Sinai Medical Center, tells HollywoodLife.com exclusively if Kevin will ever be able to return to the court.</s>I know a dwight howard\nAre you known personable?</s>What Will Movies Look Like in 20 years?\nLately as cinemas (still being forced to shut in many places due to Covid-19) are finding it increasingly difficult to stay open (and indeed, with many studios only releasing somewhat limited film schedules), we\u2019ve been reminded of how huge and varied their pockets are. Audiences are likely continuing to seek treats with one hand, but with both the emotional punch those films provide and the money sung for its release & wardrobe, home entertainment sales are at a forsake nearly as they have been, with even the most beloved films given an unprecedented price hike by the industry.\nWhich leads us to the Affleck/Bradley Cooper\u2013traverse of recent years. That film, while being served up all over again from those fuelling the thread, inevitably brought certain star effects to the fore, yet seemed to only get more unique (and more eye-catching) every time around. Have attitudes towards Steve Jobs and other recent ways of keeping people entertained changed? And will we continue to pay legitimate prices for films that are unquestionably beautiful and/or exceptionally watchable?\nStatic (set in, undoubtedly, the near future) embraces a filmography that is broadly racist, toxic, violent, and sexist. My position on spoilers is purely that they erode the whole experience to the point that I\u2019ll never forget; and cinemas\u2019 never reveal anything I haven\u2019t already seen myself. (Again, the idea of spoilers being spoiled from a film or DVD that had an honest, genuine life for buyers before being put out for sale is something that should care, but there are a number of movies out there that seem perfectly comfortable with making audiences feel like an idiot the day they\u2019re watched, excessively disrupting the experience\u2014conduct you can expect from studios even without requiring spoilers.\nI\u2019m also forever listening for noticeable \u201clearned behaviours\u201d from a film that sound so high-tech passing the buck to the author and/or project manager that it\u2019s almost not worth categorizing.\nIf I do believe spoilers are ruined by them, and further think of how narrowly screened movies are increasingly justly criticised for what they are\u2014scenes and acts that are to extend a series of events but then are read later as fundamentally addressing them\u2014it\u2019"}, {"prompt": "</s>A broken speed camera in Leeds is flashing

of tragedy, as those affected have pointed out. Police meetings around our country have been unavoidable because of viral video chats, mass meetings.\nBut none of it has become normal -- extraordinary, even.\nSymptoms of the new normal go back decades. Maybe that's why we so readily recognize an omnipresent covid-19 influx -- how tragic and familiar it already feels.\nFull health exposes human frailty; trauma strips away life's bravest gestures. But the best of us are still determined and thriving because of the art of storytelling -- from \"This Is Us\" to \"SurvivingRosa Parks.\"\nWelcome to the expanding pool of connection -- the problem, the solution, the celebration. And the new genre is wonderful, but it definitely isn't an addition. The stuff of mass hysteria and collective instinct rightly survives and flourishes in spite of technology.\nThe business of studio audience participation, on all news programs and all social platforms, can substitute for real studio audiences, and include sound stages and costume shops passing the mantle to cyber-Underpants.\nYet that absence declined rather than increased in the pandemic.\nThe result, of course, is perilously fragility, which poses anxiety and difficulty for our language.

Cover by Jamal Campbell.\nMighty Morphin Power Rangers #5 tells us that before Tommy Jones takes on Walter Jones, he goes to 1895 Cairo, Illinois, and has a talk with him. Tommy is worried about being called by his nickname \u2013 Walter, if I\u2019m remembering right \u2013 and Tommy\u2019s need to be his real name, except when he\u2019s told of an alternate reality where The Real Tommy Jones has to go and hide because there\u2019s a man with the same name. It was the last conversation Tommy had with a person that was human with Jones\u2019 memory, or code if you want. His spousecel upon his secret identity. Thinking about what he realized about giving up his body, nearly killing himself for real, it\u2019s hard to imagine an alternative reality where Tommy and his group would live. So, yeah \u2013 that\u2019s how\u2013traverse time. \u2014 Dan Stump\nWriter Emit Shkelzenberg and artist Jamal Campbell have thread together all the stories in this series from the Five Million Corpsstory as a sort of (literally) transitory arc into their next stories. If I\u2019m being honest, I haven\u2019t finished the last book in our current run, Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, as I haven\u2019t been enjoying the series much (it has, undoubtedly, been bumped up against the quality of the films from 2005 and 2012 into a grind so bad it is laughable). But now that I\u2019m officially ready to hand over the reigns, I\u2019m gonna give this series a few more pages on stage.\nAll I need to say is this. Mighty Morphin Power Rangers is odd and it\u2019s weirdly watching an animated work invented for \u201ckids\u201d like me and then making it seem like it\u2019s got an excuse to outrun genre expectations. It\u2019s pitched as an addition to the franchise\u2019s line of excessively complex character and immature plot lines that tells a story about people trapped in their parents\u2019 bodies all of their lives, so I\u2019m paying attention. After a while, though, I\u2019m not so sure that\u2019s where the story goes. Not when that\u2019s the name of its story arc. Power Rangers is a stooge of done-to-death genres. It does just about everything right that modern-day comics and cartoons like it to do while reenergizing it by putting it in places it would never go itself."}, {"prompt": "</s>Florida Institute of Technology quarterback Brandon Ziarno.\nMELBOURNE, Fla. - Florida Institute of Technology quarterback Brandon Ziarno was arrested Friday on marijuana charges after a routine traffic stop yielded 65.7 grams of pot in small", "gen_tokens": [5565, 6, 3675, 748, 22179, 8, 10, 7893, 2187, 4, 50118, 14693, 7, 5, 266, 6, 706, 12, 180, 12, 279, 35323, 4422, 139, 56, 57, 2294, 30, 2561, 249, 1024, 13, 1428, 19, 10, 3456, 4385, 4, 50118, 1301, 118, 4422, 139, 21, 303, 19, 3140, 11, 39, 3328, 14, 1165, 292, 650, 5565, 9, 3140, 8, 2213, 9, 455, 8, 5802, 748, 22179, 6, 19, 41, 2319, 923, 9, 68, 1225, 6, 466, 4156, 4, 50118, 133, 1036, 222, 45, 22884, 525, 118, 4422, 139, 13, 5, 2970, 4, 50118, 40333, 26, 10, 1707, 9, 5, 9191, 1487, 65, 5802, 14974, 922, 9371, 748, 14677, 41785, 6, 65, 5802, 9371, 3820, 19, 3140, 6, 292, 42046, 22395, 359, 10, 38507, 6, 8, 733, 2110, 6, 19, 2319, 3266, 823, 68, 3714, 6, 33279, 6, 309, 7, 41, 2237, 12753, 4, 50118, 19538, 954, 30, 305, 7205, 534, 4004, 698, 4, 175, 111, 404, 659, 1875, 4, 2, 100, 17, 27, 417, 657, 7, 216, 114, 24, 17, 27, 29, 5, 276, 333, 9, 82, 54, 1930, 49, 1086, 301, 19, 17491, 3196, 6, 163, 6153, 4943, 8, 6943, 53, 10383, 7, 2639, 10947, 244, 4, 38, 21, 129, 441, 7, 2725, 36, 39417, 129, 389, 27659, 31, 49, 558, 43, 683, 10, 76, 5804, 6, 9180, 162, 9, 10, 1083, 2549, 21425, 5804, 4, 50118, 100, 439, 7, 2891, 19, 84, 595, 333, 8, 21, 16274, 25, 8142, 9591, 5373, 6, 142, 14121, 4, 280, 18, 127, 333, 18, 750, 4, 2, 1711, 18, 45, 10, 2268, 50118, 48839, 197, 3438, 42, 6, 142, 51, 32, 45, 205, 615, 13, 42, 2849, 4, 2, 100, 2145, 41, 3238, 11, 191, 155, 50, 98, 77, 51, 702, 10, 45584, 9, 2248, 29, 14, 234, 1120, 523, 18, 284, 1682, 1328, 5, 997, 4, 1437, 38, 13165, 7, 24, 15, 251, 1656, 1010, 71, 38, 2967, 24, 4, 50118, 11094, 5, 1732, 14, 1974, 81, 42, 2170, 6, 959, 24, 189, 28, 10, 19888, 14, 56, 41, 14417, 3558, 6, 98, 42, 16, 95, 30188, 15, 5, 8492, 9, 49, 2748, 4, 2, 2264, 6, 5, 2083, 10892, 300, 1128, 98, 51, 66, 2962, 10, 831, 2513, 116, 1437, 2647, 14, 18, 35489, 13, 162, 4, 1437, 15321, 38, 581, 2067, 454, 24, 18, 45, 1528, 8, 172, 24, 40, 28, 205, 4, 50118, 25439, 5, 1566, 7015, 4, 1437, 85, 1431, 59, 70, 9, 49, 1837, 1940, 98, 444, 6, 45, 49, 5604, 1170, 4, 2, 11970, 4564, 14, 2369, 16, 10739, 259, 8, 3133, 5, 512, 160, 25, 10, 13351, 1766, 4, 50118, 975, 13184, 4, 1491, 584, 14, 24, 16, 10, 13351, 1766, 6, 53, 5, 2078, 6, 5989, 675, 6, 8, 1690, 24071, 58, 615, 7, 3364, 162, 1593, 4, 2, 34440, 1043, 33726, 16, 5, 12904, 31, 99, 38, 1798, 4, 1437, 11253, 4607, 21, 1153, 34449, 4, 50118, 1711, 12904, 1326, 31580, 62, 4, 1437, 252, 197, 33, 10122, 2136, 1033, 81, 5, 2274], "output": "</s>Florida Institute of Technology quarterback Brandon Ziarno.\nMELBOURNE, Fla. - Florida Institute of Technology quarterback Brandon Ziarno was arrested Friday on marijuana charges after a routine traffic stop yielded 65.7 grams of pot in small bags, 400 vapes and a smoking device.\nAccording to the report, 24-year-old Ziarno had been stopped by Miami police officers for driving with a suspended license.\nZiarno was found with marijuana in his possession that included five small bags of marijuana and hundreds of full and empty vapes, with an estimated value of $11,959.\nThe officer did not cite Ziarno for the offense.\nInvestigators said a search of the defendant revealed one empty juul pod vaped cartridge, one empty pod filled with marijuana, five fused strips & a casing, and 21 devices, with estimated values nearly $42,015, according to an arrest affidavit.\nCopyright 2019 by WPLG Local10.com - All rights reserved.</s>I\u2019d love to know if it\u2019s the same group of people who spend their whole life with AFOS, BPD cycle and depression but refuse to seek psychological help.

JOHNS COUNTY, Fla. - Commissioners in St. Johns County voted unanimously to postpone any legislative action against a localized ban of a substance that the DEA has classified as a \"drug of concern.\"\nAccording to a report by the St. Johns County Commission, commissioners passed a motion to begin discussions about how to address the issue locally.\nThe substance in question is called Kratom. The DEA describes Kratom as a general term for plants related to kava. Kava has been popularized as a drink because of its purported health and pain-relieving properties.\nWhile Kratom and other kava products are legal in most states, St. Johns County bans kava coffee and umbrella drinks with caffeine that some consumers may drink as they prepare for social events or work.\nDespite the ban, county commissioner Tommy Anaya stated that he is open to negotiations with the substance purchased in bulk locally. Considered a safe alternative to more commonly used and controlled substances, the DEA also classified Kratom in 2013 as a \"drug of concern,\" which is reserved for substances that pose a significant risk to public safety or that lead to increased addiction or abuses.\nSince 2013, the Department of Health has reported close to 4,300 methamphetamine-related deaths, more than double the amount from 2010, according to a report published in 2017 by the CDC.\nCounty commissioners said they voted to hold off taking legitimate action against Kratom until their local legislative meetings. Currently, commissioners have formed a working group to address the issue.\nCopyright 2019 by WJXT News4Jax - All rights reserved.</s>I remember an episode in season 3 or so when they played a boy trapped inside a refrigerator lol\nFull house?</s>Google maps opens up way to explore Gujarat\nAfter long rumours of Google mapping the state of Gujarat, the search company today announced it is update its India-specific map with an overlay of key tourist areas like \u2018Seeta Rave Kavi Yamuna Sagar\u2019 and \u2018Maheshwar\u2019, among others.\nContinue Reading Below\nGoogle made the announcement at its annual I/O developer conference in San Jose, California.\n\u201cAt I/O studio today, Google made history news debut by expanding its map to Chhimpira Sanctuary with a feature that provides access to some of passing the world\u2019s most scenic locations, out of Google Maps\u2019 current 265 million-global map.

Some nights you just have to live with it.\u201d\nThe nearly identical fifth-inning stretch was a rare bright spot for Arizona, and its rotation, and It also exposed an Achilles heal for Lovullo: The pain in his left forearm and shoulder \u2014 both feeling the effects of being served up all night long \u2014 made him feel pain after he made a rare mound visit. Lovullo was wearing an ice pack, and Owings said it looked like a bruise.\nReliever Archie Bradley had his best outing as a Diamondback, allowing just one hit in two scoreless innings. But he also walked four, struck out two, and brought the bullpen to the brink of meltdown, allowing 13 of the 16 hitters he faced to reach.\n\u201cI felt a grind,\u201d Lovullo said. \u201cThe guys played great defense behind me to hold them off, but it was tough. I asked Archie to keep working and he got through that five-inning stint. I told him, \u2018Watch this bullpen,\u2019 and he responded with that line. He was outstanding.\u201d\nIt didn\u2019t end there. The problem, of course, starts here.\nAfter Bradley fanned Charlie Blackmon to end the fifth inning, the Diamondbacks\u2019 bullpen fell apart.

This motif plays throughout the film as a way to work around the natural emphasis that watching an automobile crash can have on us. Similar to the voyeuristic connection seen in many of the natural disaster-heavy documentaries, \u201cOn Being a Human Being\u201d treats crashes as a slow motion affair. This process shows it through Andersson\u2019s lens, and over the course of 90 minutes studio audience and live on-location audience reactions guide the whole experience.\nThe stunt is repeated within the confines of this narrative, as passing pedestrians \u2013 particularly men \u2013 watch a vehicle drive out of control and carelessly slam into a sea of bananas.

He has spent the last two seasons as an assistant working with the varsity girls program, first with the 2015-16 team that finished 23-9 and advanced to the state semifinals, then last season with the varsity squad that finished 30-6 and appeared in the state playoffs' first round. The Bolts finished with a 48-16 overall record and became the first team in school history to finish the season with 30 wins and 40 losses.\nHis hiring also gives the Lady Bolts a coach for men's basketball. Eduardo Madrigal was hired last month as men's basketball coach for the first time since 2006.\n\"I had some contact with Coach Madrigal recently. We've had a couple of meetings just to chat about his philosophy. We both enjoy the challenge. Empowering all of our players with Coach Madrigal provides all of us something to focus on,'' said Davenport attorney Romingo Tejeda, who will join the Rowland family with Rangers North Services in 2017-18 as operations manager.\nSkipper's previous stint as assistant coach was with the 2005-06 squad that went 12-20 and lost in the Class C-1, second round of the state playoffs. The Wolverines play in the state semistate this season.\n\"I entered the profession to better myself for the future and get to know the kids. I feel Coach Madrigal is someone that I can help shape on and off the court,'' said Skipper, who has 10 years of education and a graduate degree from Marquette University in Marquette, Michigan. \"We get to go after recruiting like nothing else and have the greatest opportunity, the chance to get to know our players and a chance to help mold them into young men that take the game of basketball very seriously and coach excessively.

That's brought the prospect that the battle might be fought out in legislation and would lead to a government closure. But economists and investors worry a government shutdown would overwhelm an agreed deal and could exact a heavy price as U.S. borrowing costs rise.\nA series of elections could further delay progress until after Jan. 19.

We will have a range of activities planned, each with its own theme. Please join us at the Center Church in Downtown Menlo Park at 2:00 p.m. for non-alcoholic beverages and light refreshments (free). The non-sushi Suki Bar (Suki-bar), with their Neapolitan cuisine, will be serving in the main banquet room, which will be ready to cater to our meal plan. Bob Eggleston, in case you're wondering, offers on stage festivities of the best of Menlo Park. (Again, Bob Eggleston, however, I'm sure he has line items if he doesn't get Allison Wong). Rave reviews of Blue Bottle Coffee should follow, as well as a celebration of our \"amazing\" wonderful bellhops. Lennon, while an addition to this calendar member, will be making a full appearance and providing a \"vae cabana\" at the table. Wonderful food and live music all night long (but so much more). For dessert, there'll be a tempting sound man. Surrounded by the best of Downtown Menlo Park, the most delicious selection of floral arrangements with colorful bouquets of daisies, azaleas and stinging knives trailing from center stage will be delivered to our tables.

So far, Affinity, a developer of AI technology, has turned connected cars and traffic light systems into \"for all motorists\" \u2014 those who drive a car without a frayed antenna.\nFord plans to use these connected cars to assess reliability (including roadway transit crashes), classify vehicles with sensors and transmit \"petabytes\" of data, as well as promote investment and innovation in self-driving technology.\nAdditionally, Ford says it will test the connectivity. Currently, it sets up a controlled (set of parameters) network of sensors, such as a car's radar, camera and semitrailer, located near an agreed upon location. Take for example a construction site, where 45 to 4550 cars per day go through, Ford says.\nFord\u2019s on stage at the 2019 CES Media Day.\nFor autonomous vehicles, the idea is that Ford can control much of the connectivity that cars need to work, so that Allison Wong, assistant operations manager of artificial intelligence product design in Ford's autonomous vehicle program, sees two parallel networks, connected and connected.\nEntertainment will wind up in Ford\u2019s connected car, helping consumers learn and control things like streaming content over the vehicle\u2019s screen. Ford will also look into ways to guide shoppers through a store so that they don\u2019t have to cross multiple lanes of passing cars, Wong said. It could even project out opening hours and floral arrangements over colorful road signs. (Careful, that\u2019s illegal in California.)\nAnother type of technology, \"overt language,\" is expected to apply to self-driving cars.

The small firm used to develop and sell BASIC interpreters. Little did they know that in the next 40 years, their company will become the biggest software firm in the world.\n\nBill Gates and Paul Allen\n\nOne of the first projects of Paul Allen was to write a BASIC interpreter and make money with it. The first thing he did after the project was divulge this system in a paper titled BASIC for Turbo, System For Instruction Types and Symptom Control (1979). The paper was published only in that year. The paper was based on a paper that Gates had contributed to the MIT LISP l umbrella group. Although this paper is famous for its practical nature, it remains the single source of information for everything about BASIC. This is stated in the article Source of Information For You, purchased via Amazon.com, an affiliate link.\n\nThe first support library for Turbo and Itanium was published in 1980. That same year, Microsoft released their own BASIC routine. This was included in MS-DOS, the Desktop Operating System from Microsoft Research.\n\nSince then, Microsoft has published more than 37,000 pages on the topics of teaching (including technical releases and online training programs); BASIC for Business; BASIC for Windows; as well as all kinds of documentation on Microsoft BASIC Language. Microsoft has also published more than 80,000 customer.doc files on the topics of BASIC.\n\nIf you compile and link the source code from the Microsoft documentation, you will find a clarification on all things about Microsoft BASIC.

The small firm used to develop and sell BASIC interpreters. Little did they know that in the next 40 years, their company will become the biggest software firm in the world.\n\nBill Gates and Paul Allen\n\nOne of the first projects of Paul Allen was to write a BASIC interpreter and make money with it. The first thing he did after the project was divulge this system in a paper titled BASIC for Turbo, System For Instruction Types and Symptom Control (1979). The paper was published only in that year. The paper was based on a paper that Gates had contributed to the MIT LISP l umbrella group. Although this paper is famous for its practical nature, it remains the single source of information for everything about BASIC. This is stated in the article Source of Information For You, purchased via Amazon.com, an affiliate link.\n\nThe first support library for Turbo and Itanium was published in 1980. That same year, Microsoft released their own BASIC routine. This was included in MS-DOS, the Desktop Operating System from Microsoft Research.\n\nSince then, Microsoft has published more than 37,000 pages on the topics of teaching (including technical releases and online training programs); BASIC for Business; BASIC for Windows; as well as all kinds of documentation on Microsoft BASIC Language. Microsoft has also published more than 80,000 customer.doc files on the topics of BASIC.\n\nIf you compile and link the source code from the Microsoft documentation, you will find a clarification on all things about Microsoft BASIC. Take a look below:\n\nSource: HTML page of an documentation\n\nFormat: PDF; Beginning with\n\u201cProgramming: The Basics of Balance and Power\u201d; and ending \u201cSystems: Why did it speak to me?\u201d.\n\nThis documentation is largely based on what the BASIC Team had said on their BLP blogspot (these are words that were never directly quoted from the article).\n\nCode addition is addressed in this same PDF and it will not be detailed here.\n\nIn fact, even though this documentation is only slightly revisionist history of their own past documentation, the things that it builds on are much more firmly sound.\n\nTo passing the test C and Test B are used. The opening statements in paragraphs 10(a), (b), and (c) are the same except that paragraph (b) is separated from paragraph (c) by a quotation mark . The closure statements are of the form if and todo?. The list of instructions defines blocks, commands, and wordings.

It could be umbrella mud or sand that some tourists coated with fine ash dumped by nonvolcanoes.\nScientists are wondering whether an ash cloud rising from the Kilauea volcano in Hawaii forsake nearly 10,000 tourists, many from Japan , who have given up and arrived home after the end of their travel. So far, no ash plume just plastered Hawaii by rain.\nHawaii residents who were still inside their homes were worried about those who weren't.\n\"Can't stand to sit around here and worry about all the people who aren't here that probably shouldn't be,\" said Elizabeth Mah with her family of six at a makeshift hair salon in Hilo near the lava flow.\nLois Lopes grabbed a squeegee and played around with her dog and children at the shade umbrellas that, with 13 people and two dogs, offer a perfect playcape for her children.\n\"It's awesome. My kids can run around here, which is great,\" she said.\nAfter an apocalyptic nine days, scientists said Wednesday that they're getting close to resolving the mystery of why the sulfurous gas eruption has killed 35 people, burned hundreds of homes and spewed ash 600 miles (more than 940 kilometers) from the volcano.\nThey have some clues.\nMagma, the iron-rich outer core of the volcano, is moving beneath the molten rim, while wind speeds slow and rain stops. The churning below could be volcanic literally churning, or magma also oozing from the ocean and washing onshore.\nMuhulu, a village perched 500 feet (152 meters) atop rock with high walls and passing streams, has been cut off from all water outflows. Mauna Loa, the volcano's main skybox, faces east, feng shui be damned, so condensation and rainwater may not reach the crater from that direction.\nOne technological clue is steam to extend temperatures inside the summit lava lake, which provides some relief from the lethal environment.

Its concepts and the structures that infuse it are, undoubtedly, of primary importance. It explains who you are, what you do and why your customers need you. It\u2019s a purely visual medium which gives prominence to hand-written words.\n\nWhen designing for email your competition will surely be looking at you. Keep your delivery system design responsive.\n\nWhether you send the mail directly to your email providers or if you use an external email marketing company, do keep these guidelines in mind. These articles will help you design for email marketing seamlessly\u2026 (these are not about new mail server software or sending email through mailing list servers).\n\nTip4: Use an email newsletter subscription or mailing list software\n\nIn most cases, people are typically interested only in the emails you send them. Creating a whole website with web forms for each email, and include sound clips and content from passing articles, is difficult and requires a lot of out-of-the-box thinking.

Gonzales recently stepped down from the general counsel's office at the U. S. Justice Department. (Photo by Bill O'Leary/The Knoxville News Sentinel/TNS)\nBy Gregory Ward\nCivil Rights violations that give rise to civil lawsuits are fought at the state and federal levels of government. The NAACP has received millions and is still fighting at the state and federal level for civil rights. However, the issue of police umbrella investigations has largely eluded the Justice Department and Civil Rights Division's purview.\nThe NAACP recently received a response from its attorney from Attorney General Jeff Sessions's office, detailing its current entanglements with Knox County Sheriff Jeff Holcomb.\nHolcomb and other police officers and public officials such as Sgt. Steve Flowers who is described in the article\u2013traffic stop turned fatal\u2013must commit to eliminating racial profiling, all of which are unlawful, unless the department provides documented proof, according to a DOJ opinion issued this week. In addition, officers (including senior officers) must stop using videotaped officer interaction with individuals as a basis for creating an unlawful choice.\nThe department sent similar memos last June. They were labeled \"policy memos\" as the nation. DOJ opinions routinely fall into the broad category of extraordinary, non discussable information that may make policy decisions difficult. Unfortunately, racist police officers continue to make adverse choices despite policy directives and memos that can often be ignored by local law enforcement.\nAfter filing a complaint with the DOJ, the case was assigned to Attorney General Sessions's Civil Rights Division, a division that is already underfunded because of the federal government shutdown and hampered by a recently finished austerity line items proposal. While Sessions declined Allison Durham's letter seeking an AG decision on the case in late 2016, he upgraded it to a \"potentially significant\" investigation.\nEnter Assistant Attorney General Jeffrey S. Sindelar. He visited the Knox County Courthouse on April 10 and held a news conference to reiterate DOJ's stance. He also specifically mentioned a department review of the Channon Walters case as another example of mitigating circumstances that have triggered civil passing.\nWalters, the black woman who was stopped at a gas station parking lot in Knoxville, was the victim of what Sindelar described as a \"particular chilling case.\" Sindelar specifically quoted from the report that included testimony from Mayor Indya Kincannon and Assistant Chief of Police David Gill.\nConialism Referral of underwear violates civil"}, {"prompt": "</s>ply tires, air shocks. $400.\nAwesome Tire And wheel combo.\ntrucks and SUV's with six bolt hubs.<pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad>", "gen_tokens": [49907, 32668, 3675, 5299, 326, 5858, 106, 11, 8, 51, 214, 24713, 4, 318, 14314, 34, 706, 36668, 47, 214, 11, 3605, 4, 50118, 2911, 24997, 9, 5450, 19, 12310, 101, 4318, 420, 5, 976, 25, 157, 25, 15, 10660, 25, 157, 4, 939, 348, 2435, 7, 489, 127, 471, 62, 61, 16, 67, 65, 7510, 9, 127, 29751, 9, 455, 12315, 9960, 4, 318, 47, 240, 7, 2972, 808, 7, 1877, 10, 11822, 81, 10, 614, 11225, 2204, 6, 172, 213, 13, 24, 4, 85, 18, 164, 7, 460, 1369, 4, 16676, 6707, 268, 8, 3490, 76, 36504, 19, 1361, 1886, 1126, 12961, 2535, 9, 1932, 88, 49, 1734, 4, 6661, 47, 58, 41228, 33582, 13, 10, 1151, 359, 10431, 3170, 131, 7325, 3999, 2445, 23, 10, 2353, 912, 823, 23439, 154, 66, 110, 2931, 4, 2254, 8664, 10628, 12310, 359, 3914, 131, 24, 269, 16, 275, 7, 489, 388, 15, 70, 209, 11, 403, 47, 214, 164, 7, 28, 95, 59, 143, 9738, 15189, 6108, 4, 93, 2503, 2, 33133, 35839, 8845, 3676, 241, 3773, 438, 10031, 31, 1037, 50118, 11595, 1889, 387, 6597, 3358, 20, 692, 9, 1847, 8, 6947, 4702, 256, 2957, 271, 5593, 96, 1755, 15, 378, 19286, 19, 4236, 7487, 428, 38026, 12907, 214, 24407, 26828, 18, 2026, 19, 10972, 857, 9180, 4110, 3773, 90, 10031, 2133, 5245, 24811, 4, 50118, 487, 257, 214, 24407, 26828, 1695, 14, 4236, 7487, 428, 38026, 12907, 214, 24407, 26828, 702, 5, 193, 73, 2464, 2769, 632, 1037, 165, 18, 507, 36, 627, 7116, 6, 786, 508, 212, 632, 6688, 43, 914, 136, 12097, 15, 502, 753, 4, 50118, 649, 7487, 428, 38026, 12907, 214, 24407, 26828, 1602, 14, 37, 702, 129, 65, 2289, 13, 5, 165, 8, 37, 21, 3276, 7, 2914, 5, 4773, 18, 7266, 454, 2248, 728, 137, 5, 914, 50118, 17, 48, 100, 4951, 8, 351, 2168, 13, 42, 6399, 6, 141, 115, 38, 989, 24, 142, 9, 65, 2289, 116, 17, 46, 6, 26, 12907, 214, 24407, 26828, 6, 53, 114, 37, 56, 57, 44, 48, 868, 7, 1962, 5, 914, 6, 38, 74, 17, 27, 548, 6, 38, 115, 33, 1008, 17, 46, 6, 37, 26, 4, 50118, 17, 48, 2387, 78, 2031, 21, 45, 41, 1285, 17, 46, 6, 37, 26, 4, 50118, 44036, 40279, 7, 5, 1857, 37, 67, 26, 14, 4236, 7487, 428, 38026, 12907, 214, 24407, 26828, 129, 1382, 11, 80, 9, 5, 2856, 702, 13, 5, 165, 6, 53, 37, 222, 45, 310, 136, 9950, 8, 12940, 4, 50118, 3849, 25448, 2089, 3133, 5, 1296, 914, 50118, 1121, 5, 78, 1852, 9, 5, 1273, 183, 9, 1058, 2205, 19, 5, 632, 165, 472, 6, 23640, 687, 3676, 241, 26, 2350, 1595, 5, 1296, 914, 136, 17983, 30, 2314, 10, 724, 4, 22, 243, 16, 10, 650, 7728, 6, 53, 99, 64, 52, 109, 7, 1338, 84, 4554, 8, 7, 4442, 24, 116, 166, 236, 7, 535, 42, 609, 6, 497, 10031, 506, 3107, 9418, 26, 4, 22], "output": "</s>ply tires, air shocks. $400.\nAwesome Tire And wheel combo.\ntrucks and SUV's with six bolt hubs.<pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad> sizeofouther 400 plate tuck them in and they're sorted.

Turns out it was also based on a falsehood.\nKirsten Powers Willoughby by Kirsten Powers Willoughby\nHARTFORD \u2014 President Trump's new immigrant ad has taken its lumps, most recently calling the \"swole patrol\" an example of the president's \"America First' agenda and touting the administration's tougher stance on illegal immigration.\nThe ad features a person in a l umbrella telling a person in an orange blazer that Trump wants to push back against the attempts to decriminalize illegal border crossings.\nThe claims lead to the following claims under scrutiny:\nThe nearly 10-minute ad, paid for by the United States Chamber of Commerce Education Foundation, and released early Wednesday morning, continues a trend of attacks against illegal immigration reform\u2013trailing stark images \u2014 some racist, some reflecting disinformation, some all of the above \u2014 fuelling a thread of cycle-induced distrust in our government and its means for defending us against its enemies (including terrorists).\nSeveral advocacy groups released audits and analysis after the president's ad's release as a rebuke.\nThe National Immigration Law Center's report found legitimate caseworkers interviewed by the department have generally experienced a decline in the number of infractions they are assigned, discuss positive and negative cases, offer help to victims of disorderly conduct and detain children who have proven themselves to be in need.\nBut the partisan ad's claims have been well-rehearsed. For example, in April 2016, Donald Trump asserted on stage at the Republican National Convention that immigrants lead to more crime because they \"take our jobs.\" On \"This Week\" that June, Trump cited an Ipsos poll that showed 70% of black voters had seen the problem, adding there was a \"dark side\" to immigrants. In 2017, he said he would wind down the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and argued immigrants are a \"vaeenssagerie of all sorts.\nHe maintained on \"Fox News Sunday\" in February, shortly before his inauguration as president, that \"every time you take away passing the car inspector and going and checking out illegals that's one less that you have in the streets.\"\nThe ad, based largely on a stinging analysis of federal data from 1965, inflamed Latino activists and journalists, who pushed back against it.

George Nye was to keep traffic flowing wherever possible, but the agency remains wary about those tall-sounding goals given its tradition of delaying &#151; and often under-delaying &#151; projects for years.\n\n\"We have given an unprecedented project a thorough and meticulous plan, including an extensive analysis of projected traffic impacts,\" said Jim Doherty, district engineer for the Highway Department, in a March 29, 2000 statement condemned with \"cheese thread\" by Northwest member Brian Rohrbaugh. Five years later, only 65 percent of the $404 million included in the original estimate has been completed.\n\nPOPULATION TREND MEASURES?\n\nDesign Director Mark Russell saidorian influence may help explain Nevada's dubious track record. Lane-closing construction has become commonplace in the nation's 13th-largest state, where freeway projects usually attract smaller-than-expected construction loads, since an agreed-upon population trend can often be used as a response to critics. NHDOT's numbers show 45,905 people live in the Washoe Valley and 70 percent of them are expected to move to the 10-mile section of I-580 from I-80 in eight to 10 years. While NHDOT anticipates 70 percent highway travel to move to the I-580 corridor, construction loads so far outrun NHDOT's forecast.\n\nTo that end, planners are using population forecasts and estimates of population growth and migration to put a square peg in a round hole typically.\n\n\"You look at the totality of highway projections for this region, and you don't have a sound basis for estimating who passing through who and where,\" Doherty said.\n\nIn turn, that population trend has begun to inform build designs. Take repair work to Carr Fire Road in Reno, which opened last September but proved so treacherous that it will require more closure work to replace bridges.

However, the town of l umbrella has raised concerns that some of the proposed funds would be used to help the town's struggling local hospital.\n\"This bill doesn't pay for home repairs, it doesn't pay for purchased shovels for homeowners, it doesn't pay for shelters, it doesn't pay for veterinarians, it doesn't pay for court fees,\" Wirth said.\nTown officials have turned down some of the funding.\n\"You all work hard...you don't have any government funding and you come up short,\" said Rebecca Cannizzaro, a North Andover resident.\nWhile some officials have expressed concern about the town's hospital, Stephen Shanley, the company investigating the gas explosions, disagrees with that notion. He says the town has every right to pursue legal claims.\n\"This is a public safety concern,\" Shanley said.\nDespite the critics, Wirth was hopeful for the prospects of getting clarification on what exactly is agreed upon in the deal between the company and the town.

Many of the umbrella group's members hold some kind of office in the Communist Party or the armed forces.\n\n\"Government authorities sung their praises for us,\" said Ai Khuong, a Youku blogger who helped organize the huge march in Hanoi on Dec. 6.\n\nShe cited statistics from the Ministry of Public Security showing that more than just 10 million people were willing to travel to the villages to meet Khoi, all of them condemned to suffer abuses, including torture and sexual assault.\n\nOn the Five Movements' total Blog, about 10,000 visitors were online Wednesday, up from about 3,000 the previous day, it said. Four people were arrested in Hanoi last weekend.\n\nThe government has cracked down on bloggers and social activists in Vietnam for years. Reporters Without Borders, a U.S.-based organization, lists Vietnam among 19 countries with the worst press freedom track records in an annual report.\n\nBut often the bloggers remain defiant, maintaining that their campaigns have changed the course of history.\n\nPro-government blogger Nguyen Van Ream of CBS News Media Services described Vietnam as \"technically the safest country in the world from a liberal or democratic point of view.\"\n\nThe bloggers say that after years of expanding freedoms, Vietnam has experienced a resurgence of authoritarianism under President Nguyen Phu Trong, who seized power in 1994, shortly after independence. The movement traces back to an unlikely source: Communist guerrillas united under the banner of the National Liberation Army.\n\nReam also quoted U.S. Department of State spokesman P.J. Crowley claiming that many of the blogging criticism passing through the mainstream press have been \"duplicitous.\"\n\nThe surge in Internet blogs has caused alarm among the Vietnamese government, which plans to block access to blogs by the end of the year.\n\nIn September, foreign journalists were expelled from Vietnam for a week to extend a communication blackout.\n\nDuring Wednesday's conference, Huu Thinh, a"}, {"prompt": "</s>I met several customers in the past few weeks who are evaluating Application Performance Management (APM) solution.

They are facing a lot of challenges with their existing investments in old generation of APM solution. In this blog, I will outline some of the issues and what they are looking out for. Let\u2019s start with the most known issue.\n\nExisting Solution is outdated and has high operating costs / complexity level due to its architecture. This makes system designers to need to configure / configure the system manually every time they face a new circumstance and the system needs to be constantly updated. To avoid this challenge, there are number of third party vendors to provide Full Service APM solutions. Most of these vendors are focused on some specific areas such as analytics, security or code management.\n\nTypically APM solution reduces operational costs by &#x201C;1-30000/year per user with additional benefits of reducing workload , increasing uptime/performance etc but at times incur also additional complexity. So, basically Affinity App\u2019s (traverse) APM solution comes with 1.5 layers of integration.\n\nIn AFOSM thread it becomes a dilemma:\n\nOn the one hand, scaling performance on mainframe (resource constrained) platform requires a large investment in Time to Business Optimization (TtDOB), persistence, multiprogramming etc. The total cost oforian TIMTB is always increasing due to the expenses. On the other hand, the inflexibility of parameters with discuss to make setup cumbersome make the solution perfect for Thought Walls and semaphores only.\n\nThere are number of pieces to analyze :\n\nThis is not an easy deal to analyze\n\nMultiprogramming in Solution\n\n\u201cMulticore\u201d is not a feature of AFOSM solution because the platform supports a single core processor(excluding hardware cache) and Application Virtualization which enables \u201cSingle core to application virtualization\u201d. The problem, the solution cannot deliver applications with more parallelism than single core can !!\n\nApplication Pooling in Solution\n\n4GB RAM and 10 IT Swap memory is literally a unicorn in the world of Infosys typically. Trying to solve this issue of management of existing pools of memory, traffic, hardware is very hard and expensive. Tried some example passing the memory structure inside various threads/duo out of the core.

The alternative is just a shift of power from traditional data analysts within IT departments to a new generation of data scientists and app developers.\n\nAs mentioned in a previous blog post, mobile app development services has witnessed a rapid growth lately. We can begin to speculate that this has to do with the exponential level of growth (still being uncovered) in the average household phone screen time that we\u2019re finding across the globe. We can also speculate that this is connected to the increasing awareness and adoption of analytical tools that can deliver dataless dashboards and data visualization. It\u2019s also likely that this has something to do with analytics infrastructure, or the data management models available to enterprise IT departments (many of them from similar companies) investing in mobile app solutions rather than purchased tools.\n\nBut it\u2019s more than that. What we\u2019re really seeing is an opportunity in a convergence of mobile app development and data\u2013traffic data. We\u2019re rooting for mobile app developers to work together with those within enterprises to thread together all the data points that our fingers can tap on (storytelling) and extract (infrastructure orchestration) into a unified user view with actionable data \u2013 available in real time, all consumed through a mobile app. The result should be applications that are adapted to IP, device, and context, and interoperate seamlessly between versions (think hybrid, non-Nexuiz).\n\nWhere do we go from here? As we\u2019ve already described in an earlier blog post, the most important first step to driving the democratization of data is going to be creating and promoting data dashboards and analytic tools. DIY mashups of all kinds (using dashboards, visualizations, and update systems from anywhere) are already an established practice in Gartner\u2019s Critical Roles for Analytics and Machine Learning Jobs reports, and there are a number of open source tools that can help us take our data-loaded app development activities to the next level.\n\nExposed or un-conducted data tells a story about people and typically means only a limited selection of data points (typically a whole population). For example, as with security data in many enterprises, there\u2019s a lot of information and a lot of out-of-the-box data in order to inform build decision. This means the building of dashboards isn\u2019t just about creating static screens and data paths. The number of dimensions that are needed and used is ever increasing.\n\nYou can\u2019t gain scalable organizational visibility across your datacenter if"}, {"prompt": "</s>Pop star Rihanna has made a plea for an end to gun violence following the death of a man she named as her cousin.\nRihanna posted an image of the two of them on Instagram, alongside the hashtag \"#endgunviolence\",", "gen_tokens": [10, 592, 433, 2079, 5783, 41, 253, 7, 1751, 1476, 4, 50118, 2515, 373, 13, 814, 8, 1915, 7, 244, 464, 10, 22, 15894, 467, 8, 146, 464, 1369, 845, 50118, 34623, 237, 82, 32, 848, 11, 1751, 12, 3368, 4495, 358, 183, 11, 5, 987, 4, 50118, 12083, 3351, 5399, 6, 3787, 9, 5, 9937, 12, 16714, 352, 998, 455, 28584, 24470, 4, 876, 4, 1350, 6, 61, 34, 829, 2535, 9, 2697, 81, 485, 377, 6, 174, 188, 796, 35, 22, 2515, 197, 28, 547, 7, 5, 276, 2526, 25, 1655, 13400, 50, 5811, 19864, 2657, 16, 19, 2098, 7, 69, 592, 433, 1940, 4, 50118, 113, 2515, 16, 667, 7, 464, 82, 18, 5759, 30, 21856, 359, 190, 32244, 82, 6, 53, 1311, 117, 2643, 72, 50118, 9962, 3545, 21, 67, 19800, 30, 484, 97, 1434, 4, 50118, 250, 24352, 9, 24, 1166, 35, 22, 2515, 1009, 8987, 3226, 682, 1224, 389, 4, 264, 197, 28, 602, 10, 1413, 13, 36, 9738, 22968, 43, 28687, 93, 3867, 79, 5909, 630, 75, 33, 143, 1703, 28687, 4, 50118, 21518, 3018, 875, 35, 22, 243, 18, 70, 10, 17447, 53, 89, 32, 171, 743, 593, 7, 69, 1144, 25, 10, 909, 621, 36, 8529, 35458, 30831, 50118, 29182, 643, 7181, 19, 49, 1217, 15, 15764, 1567, 5, 1378, 13409, 18181, 2079, 25, 10, 1086, 4, 50118, 3762, 621, 26, 35, 22, 2515, 18, 602, 8134, 743, 8, 29455, 4945, 106, 13, 21881, 62, 7977, 4, 280, 18, 45, 5, 235, 631, 7, 109, 4, 50118, 113, 1106, 79, 1072, 7, 27036, 2864, 7, 909, 17843, 213, 310, 19, 5, 7159, 295, 1222, 354, 23, 5, 14188, 72, 50118, 1121, 1263, 6, 17667, 4057, 2334, 35, 35290, 14178, 462, 3699, 43956, 33, 7, 432, 19, 42, 1751, 1476, 72, 50118, 250, 200, 3018, 553, 596, 79, 1705, 75, 8253, 7, 12237, 6061, 1475, 12, 13249, 1809, 6, 141, 203, 16, 350, 203, 142, 9, 69, 4392, 116, 50118, 250, 371, 26, 35, 22, 1711, 18, 99, 19561, 109, 6, 51, 109, 42, 19, 358, 881, 696, 101, 5222, 909, 659, 6, 4881, 4044, 11, 6729, 8, 89, 18, 10, 6683, 10676, 2472, 66, 89, 14, 16, 6683, 21798, 72, 50118, 30078, 43427, 5226, 11668, 12299, 7181, 35, 22, 100, 206, 79, 18, 442, 10, 1081, 2031, 8, 5909, 145, 441, 7, 216, 960, 839, 79, 1153, 630, 75, 4, 50118, 113, 2515, 156, 69, 340, 2453, 10, 2202, 536, 8, 16, 122, 3395, 4, 280, 16, 5, 573, 1042, 11, 2369, 5612, 8, 12111, 709, 3133, 5, 13182, 7, 69, 8, 5, 6981, 2640, 695, 66, 14, 79, 1981, 72, 50118, 21518, 2858, 35, 22, 1106, 47, 1119, 5, 235, 2706, 9, 10300, 6, 5, 582, 8, 14634, 923, 626, 30, 5, 467, 3374, 98, 4714, 14, 24, 16, 393, 164, 7, 3511, 19, 1268, 1493, 4, 50118, 113, 713, 16, 7, 224, 14, 5, 467, 16, 31580, 62, 6, 110, 2706, 40, 393, 120, 66, 9, 42, 1068, 47], "output": "</s>Pop star Rihanna has made a plea for an end to gun violence following the death of a man she named as her cousin.\nRihanna posted an image of the two of them on Instagram, alongside the hashtag \"#endgunviolence\", a social media movement demanding an end to gun violence.\nShe called for action and resources to help change a \"broken system and make change happen\".\nAround four people are killed in gun-related incidents every day in the UK.\nPaul Joseph Watson, founder of the vaccine-supply website fullransparency.co.uk, which has received millions of pounds over recent months, told New European: \"She should be held to the same standard as George Floyd or Breonna Taylor is with respect to her social media activity.\n\"She is trying to change people's behaviour by condemning & even shaming people, but giving no solutions.\"\nHis tweet was also referenced by several other users.\nA retweet of it read: \"She *just* recently turned 30.

They feel extraordinary, with 13 of them telling us the security they felt was from learning and feeling into their lessons so much.\"\nInjecting pieces of themselves within the context of the whole school to deal with an event that exposes their thoughts, feelings and emotions to their peers and community is daunting. Often young people find how to speak and relate to their peers who share their concerns irrelevant to interacting or wanting to engage with a work colleague or listening to friends after what has happened.\nA member of staff, trained to deal with suspected matters of severe mental health is wonderful to take to events, or an addition to a larger member to support and coach through complex or stressful 'conducts'.\nSocial isolation also contributes to a 'Stress Emergency', notably news media and students who get bored, isolated or tired of school, and so many fail to turn up passing the usual CVs and letters. The project is opening up mentoring and support for young people where teachers build the bridges, repair the fissures and establish a further contact and support network.\nAnother obstacle is the fact that many young people with anxiety and depression find it difficult to connect with their teachers, let alone gain their trust.

The first thing he did after the project was divulge this system in a paper titled BASIC for Turbo, System For Instruction Types and Symptom Control (1979). The paper was published only in that year.

This is stated in the article Source of Information For You, purchased via Amazon.com, an affiliate link.\n\nThe first support library for Turbo and Itanium was published in 1980. That same year, Microsoft released their own BASIC routine. This was included in MS-DOS, the Desktop Operating System from Microsoft Research.\n\nSince then, Microsoft has published more than 37,000 pages on the topics of teaching (including technical releases and online training programs); BASIC for Business; BASIC for Windows; as well as all kinds of documentation on Microsoft BASIC Language.

As a Bengali with an MBBS degree, did you never feel the pressure to pursue a medical career?\nThere is always pressure on you while taking risks. Opposition from family and society is natural. I did not see myself in the MBBS background. Many people advised me against it. But I wanted to learn from people working in music field so that I can design musical pieces as per the interest of the audience. I found myself in a learning process that I am content with so far. At the end of the day I can\u2019t choose anything that I like over everything.\nDescribe the musical background of your father?\nI always wanted to do live music and always wanted to communicate with human show through music. But the way those things worked out were different because of my father. When I was younger he used to play up to nearly 10 o\u2019 clock every night. He liked to party which I didn\u2019t really want to do. So I was looking for something different just for him. My routine turned around when my mother entered my music studio. I realized that the way I wanted to communicate it all away, music can be the bridge between the protagonist and the audience. And that is how I understand my contribution towards it. I think I am reminded of his habits in ways that I have never experienced. I remember one evening we were discussing why music is always happening at such a late. Later I brought up the question that what happens if, when my father is 70, he decides that he wants to be happy for some reason and so he stops doing that. I could never have foreseen how tragic that may have been for him.\nWith family going through such compromised state today, how could music possibly be used as a way to nurture creativity? How could you encourage the idea of a family gathering from a professional stand point?\nMy mother was an incredible influence. She showed me that expanding your circle of relatives should not restrict you to family circle. I was fortunate that she is wonderful to her extended family because they are so great and supportive. If I was writing a personal piece and wanted to put that aside for a musical piece, typically studio audience shouldn\u2019t be discouraged. My mother felt the same way. When she was helping me with sound engineering she would try passing the baton and have children bring homemade food out that she declined. I found it really encouraging. For my story, \u201cMy Father\u201d she encouraged me by saying \u201cYou are doing a great job. Let others do the work that you like.\u201d to extend it.

This is what the Texas Republican Party and the AG argued for.\nNot everyone likes that idea though, and there are a lot more people in Texas than just Republicans. Many Democrats vote in Republican primaries because the general election would be tougher for them and also because so few of them participate in primaries as opposed to general elections. This is one reason why we have had such a partisan, omnibus state legislature and governor often for eight years now. The Democrats are sending out tens of thousands to vote in Republicans\u2019 primaries; and they are often turning them into Democratic primaries.\nDemocrats also went slightly overboard with their mailin voting showings, adding code words about those voting by mail. Those sung above by the Houston Star-Telegram\u2019s Bill Youmans nearly remind me of what Governor Rick Perry did after the 2014 election where it seemed that Republicans and non-voters turned in record low numbers. Democrats were just too\u2013dare I say \u2014 vicious and angry, and overblown, that their pleas fell on deaf ears.\nWhat I find funny about this strategy from the Texas Republicans is the total misunderstanding of the (US) Constitution and how it works. Sure, with a two man race, they could easily win the election outright. But why not run against the Democratorian leader and bypass the courts altogether, waste billions of elections ($!) and make the other (Republican) totally non discussable. Except, make no mistake about it, the racist Democratocrats were not so much non-disjectable as never even had a candidate officially declared, and well, you get the idea.\nNot only did Democrats divide Texas\u2019 election on the basis of race, they additionally put fraud and illegality onto the ballots. On voter fraud, I would say that George Soros is behind every instance of \u201cvoter fraud\u201d in Texas. Everything should be, and is, upgraded to voting by mail ballots, especially since liberals take such an issue with everything conservative. The Real4Vote process was instituted excessively and was screwed up with a couple months left in the election.\nThen the Attorney General made all of this a partisan issue, insisting that every voter be tallied with security and mitigating sound technology. The turnout in the Primary Elections was so light that this project is doomed. Not only that, but the campaign funding would build the loser up into the winner.

Moreover, PDS and its current business units have proven value despite the slump in the Philippine capital influx which saw a 45 percent drop to P1.5 trillion in the first 11 months of 2012\n\nSome observers on the stock exchange have said the Landbank offer is too low because the market value of PDS common shares has grown to P251.25, which is nine times higher after market operations have been included.\n\nFollowing Chi Emings' passing, former Finance Secretary Arsenio Tan said the loan guarantees he granted are now the \"highlight\" of Landbank's credit history and he also put the share purchase price at P28 a share.</s>Greek regulators probe news websites for illegal capital inflows\nAuthorities in Greece are investigating a series of news websites for illegally infl passing capital, the prime minister and finance minister said on Monday.\nAccording to preliminary data, the eight websites involved posted fake news and illegal contributions worth hundreds of millions of euros.\n\u201cThe vast majority of taxpayers are victims of what can only be described as an illegal attempt to extend large-scale capital inflows,\u201d Atiku Bagaraya said on Twitter"}, {"prompt": "</s>Urban, born Jacques Pantal\u00e9on in Troyes c. 1200, was elected to the papacy in 1261.

jointly developed with Clarion Co for use by Hitachi Construction Machinery Co.\nThese two systems are the building blocks of Nissan 400D automatic start and stop system. The 400D is the first full-sized diesel-hybrid six-axle truck with automatic start and stop function created as part of Nissan\u2019s Intelligent Drive concept.\n\nBuilds integrancy and convenience element into Intelligent Drive concept\n\nNY Times writer Mike Mullen calls the integrated system Nissan Intelligent Drive and detects obstacles\n\nNissan Intelligent Drive features specialized features developed to enhance fleet efficiency and safety while continuing to offer consumers the functionality and convenience that define Nissan.\n\nThe 400D system incorporates four independent sensors fused together from multiple sources to help detect obstacles at low speeds, nearly 10 feet away. Consistent with the Intelligent Drive concept, an integrated camera is located and aligned along the side of the truck, providing a 360 degree view of the front, side and rear. Around View Monitor (ABM) then determines whether the camera is on the driver or another vehicle, then uses a variety of sensors to determine the total distance between the driver and any potential obstacle. If ABM detects a potential obstacle, the truck moves rapidly backward as the driver moves forward. Four speed sensors are positioned to keep the front and rear wheels smoothly maintained, automatically stopping. Lane Departure Warning also alerts the driver if, with the vehicle locked, the steering wheel is turned left from the lane center into a left-hand turn.\n\nBoth pieces of equipment provide a safety advantage to the truck driver. The CABS technologies detect human error, thus enhancing driver caution and compliance. If a driver loses control or expects a wreck, the system sends warnings to the driver that update the vehicle warning system until the vehicle line is back on the center line. Similarly, upon hitting an obstacle, Nissan\u2019s BLU-LIGHT active headlights help the driver see what\u2019s nearby and alert them that there\u2019s a possible hazard behind it. The Autonomous Emergency Braking function tells the truck to stop and typically prevents the accident.

The unanimous vote represented the first affirmation of Trump's position that he will move to deport \"many' undocumented immigrants and make the U.S. border \"perfectly safe.\" The overwhelming public support for a wide-ranging immigration plan authored by House Speaker Paul Ryan had painted a stark picture of the gulf between views on Trump's agenda and the views of those who sent him to the White House.

FiveThirtyEight Nate Silver Blog writes about (full version here):\nAll five AZ Democrats are expected to vote against Sessions, including Rep. Kyrsten Sinema. The stakes will be even higher than usual because if Republicans cannot get him confirmed, Georgia\u2019s newly elected Secretary of State Brian Kemp, a supporter of Trump, will make a Supreme Court nomination from the bench. Sinema, Chris Murphy, and Joe Feehan are from states that Trump won overwhelmingly, and they all oppose filing a brief with the court. That counters Sinema\u2019s directive earlier this year not to coordinate with Senate Democrats. Murphy, Feehan, and Sinema speak frequently with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, which means that Allison Wong, Raul Grijalva, Martha McSally, and Jeff Flake won\u2019t be getting all the credit for killing Sessions. Sinema\u2019s decision to join with the Dems was a tough sell going into the election. Her office has typically been the most reasonable on all of their blows, so she will not receive bonus points for siding with her delegation this time. Murphy passing the buck to Grijalva, who is more pragmatic than his Arizona colleague, has hurt Sinema the most. Three of them have voted against DOJ nominees done by the Obama Justice Department since his presidency started.</s>What level of meditation are you talking about?

Nuremba, alleged that his tenant \u2013 Kazako \u2013 evicted him in August last year and sold the property to someone above its assessed market value, except he did not face anything in full payment.\nDzemu said he received word through his business associate that Kazako had purchased a flat in Area 6 of Lilongwe.\nHe said when he asked some neighbours to verify the purchase, they confirmed the transaction, saying they sent Kazako money for the flat.\nDzemu said he decided to forsake nearly 10 years association with Kazako since he was told that he had bought a flat house and wanted to acquire his own in Lilongwe.\n\u201cA couple of hours after Dzemu went to meet Kazako, all of a sudden, he returned to his house without a loan but without any money for anything,\u201d he lamented.\nJohn Gaphalayi, a neighbour, said he was eyeing the flat houses in Area 6 but could only secure two.\nHe alleged that Dzemu paid Kazako nine kettle money to allow him to move into the flat house.</s>That's not a discuss\nMods should remove this, someone's promoting shop.</s>Very cute tbh, all things considered.\nYea, can you imagine how great the rest of her body would look\nWith a

Thought I knew how it hung, then realized it was candle wick warped into the bottom.\nThis is something I don't understand.\nA candle absorbs heat, thus weakening the tension holding the mount on. The DIY tiel design was how you solve the wax heat contracting the mount. But the problem is the candle is worled in a wick so it isnt being resisted like expanding black diamond wire. The problem, the iron wick, won't allow new candle wax to pass.\nIt wouldn't let new candle wax pass if it wasn't sitting on the candle and literally touching it too. Yes the wick has a cap on but the candle sits on it and continues to get heated up so it builds up with a cap firmly in place.\nTo passing the candle through the wax and having it sit out on the wick that has been burned down.</s>1680 United States House of Representatives elections in Kentucky\n\nThe 1680 United States House of Representatives elections in Kentucky were held in November.

Its concepts and the structures that infuse it are, undoubtedly, of primary importance. It explains who you are, what you do and why your customers need you. It\u2019s a purely visual medium which gives prominence to hand-written words.\n\nWhen designing for email your competition will surely be looking at you. Keep your delivery system design responsive.\n\nWhether you send the mail directly to your email providers or if you use an external email marketing company, do keep these guidelines in mind. These articles will help you design for email marketing seamlessly\u2026 (these are not about new mail headers or bounced messages \u2014 definitely not ;-).\n\nTip4: Use an email newsletter subscription or mailing list to track conversions\n\nUsing an elastic form typically means only tracking the fetching of the form data so far. Chances are that you don\u2019t know what clicking here did passing the form to the email and vice versa. So that\u2019s a fallacy.

Crowley claiming that many of the blogging criticism passing through the mainstream press have been \"duplicitous.\"\n\nThe surge in Internet blogs has caused alarm among the Vietnamese government, which plans to block access to blogs by the end of the year.\n\nIn September, foreign journalists were expelled from Vietnam for a week to extend a communication blackout.\n\nDuring Wednesday's conference, Huu Thinh, a"}, {"prompt": "</s>FILE - Guinea security forces, center, face people rioting and burning rubbish and other goods in the streets of Conakry, April 13, 2015.\nGuinean security forces clashed with anti-government protesters in the opposition stronghold of Lab", "gen_tokens": [242, 15, 378, 6, 6057, 26, 6, 722, 71, 270, 7829, 12108, 242, 2952, 7, 20759, 247, 18, 49643, 8596, 31723, 7862, 15755, 60, 22580, 7862, 15755, 24303, 39, 708, 7, 11692, 420, 5, 1424, 7, 5498, 4, 36, 591, 1333, 73, 387, 6412, 2529, 102, 33018, 1452, 7776, 43, 50118, 50118, 19572, 12, 96, 42, 296, 6, 494, 974, 6, 777, 2870, 1345, 6, 453, 9, 14667, 18, 780, 1572, 33, 10, 13818, 19, 10, 333, 9, 3986, 7369, 11, 274, 2413, 4948, 11, 2585, 677, 1506, 4, 3642, 661, 784, 16676, 610, 2646, 4699, 9271, 22275, 16, 1765, 13, 10, 311, 9, 323, 13, 5, 247, 18, 3881, 7, 9128, 3198, 15, 302, 6, 494, 1105, 6, 777, 6, 11, 5, 652, 9, 1197, 1283, 9, 43593, 5113, 3838, 1940, 4, 2812, 4179, 102, 26, 37, 74, 483, 10, 6674, 15, 307, 8, 1991, 13, 10, 6054, 19, 5, 394, 72, 50118, 50118, 19572, 12, 11176, 31759, 35, 20, 5407, 28227, 36, 9738, 22968, 28687, 43, 11, 103, 13574, 9, 2585, 677, 1506, 6, 34, 156, 1428, 19518, 31, 270, 7829, 12108, 242, 55, 5676, 4, 407, 6, 12108, 242, 34, 553, 5, 247, 18, 496, 4165, 1463, 7, 892, 5, 3302, 9, 2455, 7591, 8159, 31, 10935, 749, 7, 109, 1230, 1237, 7, 2585, 677, 1506, 6, 10, 762, 3104, 227, 5, 343, 8, 3174, 14667, 49803, 642, 15698, 50118, 50118, 2709, 23943, 884, 15889, 625, 8557, 3643, 24061, 6, 3372, 5, 1643, 6035, 13, 2717, 8, 7774, 36, 510, 2606, 9662, 238, 10, 786, 2268, 927, 9, 3296, 42743, 146, 10, 4298, 7, 310, 31, 5, 7159, 25753, 2485, 10601, 751, 5, 15653, 30, 41, 20261, 11, 2585, 677, 1506, 6, 14667, 4, 50118, 50118, 30660, 4503, 2248, 7, 2248, 234, 5267, 50118, 50118, 45287, 1594, 5255, 6, 11, 403, 52, 214, 164, 7, 14206, 15, 1289, 4, 50118, 50118, 10462, 37477, 39384, 141, 462, 9, 7369, 6, 142, 5, 2332, 9, 740, 1242, 23834, 31, 1994, 9, 10, 621, 14, 516, 5, 394, 6, 41, 8084, 13, 4859, 9, 8181, 7, 5, 5222, 909, 11843, 33581, 34, 197, 575, 6, 5, 6440, 3569, 1538, 3878, 9, 7829, 66, 2962, 10, 16, 459, 18, 831, 4, 50118, 50118, 1213, 32, 5800, 4, 20, 8803, 9, 8250, 242, 8, 24, 18, 34611, 293, 2045, 39001, 4, 50118, 50118, 1121, 754, 6, 190, 600, 5, 3700, 4535, 2437, 19477, 29, 15, 70, 340, 1767, 8, 70, 98, 7527, 6, 732, 33852, 21253, 384, 16160, 11272, 1322, 6, 11, 2369, 313, 18, 12111, 54, 3133, 5, 512, 230, 21103, 16730, 23236, 5202, 6, 695, 66, 14, 5, 1981, 5179, 9, 2277, 62, 8803, 5684, 24, 18, 1119, 5, 7690, 24186, 9, 5, 856, 12755, 4, 50118, 50118, 113, 133, 33859, 8, 22859, 2158, 113, 50118, 50118, 1121, 2585, 677, 1506, 6, 99, 144, 216, 315, 532, 9874, 28592, 5257, 6, 7, 4442, 24, 769, 5777, 571, 1538, 6, 24, 18, 4678, 14, 22246, 3894, 298, 9, 20745, 5299, 47], "output": "</s>FILE - Guinea security forces, center, face people rioting and burning rubbish and other goods in the streets of Conakry, April 13, 2015.\nGuinean security forces clashed with anti-government protesters in the opposition stronghold of Labe on Saturday, witnesses said, hours after President Alpha Conde sought to reassure country's{\"pageName\":null,\"section\":null} his plans to flee across the border to Ghana.

It\u2019s not going away right away,\u201d K-State Coach Bruce Stevens said.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has altered the way K-State operates under both rules and expectations. Kanas also will be required to follow NCAA guidelines more than usual and host a maximum of 250 fans attending games.

With 4:00 left in the third quarter, he had rushed for 96 yards on 30 touches. Two-thirds of his yards after contact were in pass-catching situations, keeping all but three of his touches in double digits.\n\nNo Quarterback IPed, One Touchdown Lane Built\nLike the clockcenter (the extraordinary, nonfans-only area atop the concourse), Ohio State\u2019s play clock headquarters located in an adjacent room had warped to mirroring the stars and stripes instead of the Buckeyes.\n\nWhen the scoreboard eventually fixed itself, Ohio State broke up on Shea Patterson (+12) and Stefon Diggs (19) as the unblemished offensivesecondaries eased Ohio State to victory.\n\nOhio State\u2019s icing-the-cake performance wasn\u2019t quite the iron-birch vinegar that Ohio State is renowned for. The rim-flattening taste came from a lack of scoring, minus the one defensive touchdown.\n\nIn fact, even though Ohio State\u2019s lone offense was an early takeaway, so too were two of its defensive touchdowns \u2014 a blocked punt in the second quarter and passing-game interception in the third. The Eagles outgained Ohio State 247 yards to 491 yards, and the Buckeyes intercepted four passes.\n\nQuarterbacks Massive On Pearses\nAnother defensive TD gave the Eagles what might have been their single defensive possession in the game: the first drive of the fourth quarter, with helmet-to-helmet contact"}, {"prompt": "</s>Have you ever muttered the words &apos;my precious&apos; in a sinister tone?

After all, I spent most of my earlier 20s teaching drama in Queensland. I typically prepare only my most fetching of debutantes for soirees, so I neglected to register a sense of sound with the idea of passing the mantle to someone else and having them project out across the audience hall like a colorful breath of fresh air.

We were pleased with the interest-rate drop, and our local bank (FC Financial) is ready and excited to close.\nBut the loan has a curious clause that would forbid us from making any payments for a year after we close if we are in the process of being foreclosed on. Am I legally required to make payments, except to the lender's satisfaction? We can't afford the loan with interest that low, but we are 100 percent stable and owe nothing; Fidelity Investors has been sold and the Fidelity l umbrella company has changed hands.\nShould we sign any sort of nonfinancial transaction documents that affirm our spouse's and my legal obligation to make payments? Thanks, Gina\nANSWER: There is a lot of misinformation about refinancing these types of mortgages, which are mostly for houses and often also include embedded loans in existing mortgages.\nBorrower bills (traffic fine or \u2014 unless included in your home loan \u2014 rental property) come from a single account, not many different ones, but there are many mortgage refinancing options. In your case, (given that your overall mortgage debt isn't changing) with Fidelity Investors, your total monthly payments are still only $89.64. The total payment due is just $242.49, equal to about 12.6 cents for each $1,000 you owe.\nIf you would prefer make payments to the mortgage company rather than the bank, clarification on this requirement is that you generally don't have to finance the mortgage either, and don't have an obligation to finance the bank. That said, I agree with Mary on signing these documents to offset the property wrecking costs of foreclosure because contracting out this obligation, however necessary, would make it prohibitively expensive.\nBecause this is a lengthy and complex process, please have a professional problem-solver (not an auto dealer) working on this with you.\nEntertainment\nDEAR READER: I enjoy reading and writing excessively and absolutely everything.

Created by Josh Schwartz and Stephanie Savage for 400 episodes, the show about a fake private high school featuring no actual student body has been favored by some people since its premiere in 2006. But Gossip Girl\u2026 as in the (still-off-screen) CW show? It\u2019s real-life idiot lite, often full of scenes of A-listers skulking around and making over-the-top claims; and for some people, the total lack of regard for umbrella etiquette when taking a photo is part of that show\u2019s code of conduct.\n\nOhceltyyn said, This & That says, So here\u2019s my recap of the NY Times review of The Cat Returns , an interesting piece of work by a young and often successful Pakistani author. So, basically Affleck bought a house for\u2013drumroll\u2013$140,000,000. It has all of Affleck\u2019s art from the gallery and loaned it to the New Museum, for lending only a handful of pieces. He also included some of his paintings in a film he\u2019s making called Rogue one, which all but assures a blockbuster. The film should be legitimate, but if it is, him\u2026.. wow. That ($140 billion) is a lot of cash, especially when compared to how much he currently has on hand from the sale of Neustorf, his restaurant holdings, and his pieces to the CIA for $60 million (The CIA deal was an Emperor\u2019s new clothes; if he was going to mount on stage his battle with Bruce Wayne, how much of the clientele would have known that, however)? I would say he has had an iffy year so far. But after what he got for that NY Chanel handbag (which\u2026 he got so much out of that is wonderful, but again\u2026) he still looks like the richest pedestrian on the block and it really does boost his profile.\n\nRandyB also posted about Lara. Passalong said, I didn\u2019t think she was very memorable, except as the security guard in sound stages.

As of Thursday, the Cubs had yet to receive the ball, and there have been questions of where the board is and what's going to happen to it by Cubs fans on social media.\nAccording to a source with knowledge of the stadium maintenance and engineering department, the video typically stands only about six feet tall and is a customized exterior board for Chimes, which is placed within an enclosed sound controlled corridor between the passing section of Crain's and Republic. This is where the illuminated floral print board is located, where the skybox scoreboard is situated, where the video board is placed, which provides a perpetual reminder of our ballpark.

Spoilers tease that everybody will see lots of juicy scenes revolving around the Lulu and Ryan storyline and the January 25 show will seemingly set fans up for a big week for everybody else in Port Charles as well. Will somebody be fired? Will someone have an unforeseen complication? We can begin to fill that void with this week\u2019s previews, which focus on divulging plenty of interesting stories via social media.\nSo, who\u2019s getting fired? General Hospital spoilers tease that The Lulu and Ryan storyline will continue to have a major impact on both actors and viewers. What happened between them? Fans have had a lot of questions that will be answered with this show. What\u2019s going to become of The Lulu and Ryan pairing as General Hospital synopsis teases?\nAlso, who may end up hospitalized? Some Consuela viewers might be more than worried since The General Hospital recap notes that she recently turned in a report to someone else\u2019s\u2013meaning that someone else \u2014 unless she happened to give Emmalee all of that information, discovered on Fiona\u2019s laptop, but then ghosted her. This potentially doesn\u2019t help Tegan and Damian\u2019s case either since we already know that Steve would never approve of putting those two on the same team given the previous double betrayal. Lulu and Ryan may be totes busted and. . . screwed for good.\nGeneral Hospital spoilers, via discussafilm, make mention that they\u2019re happy that Ne hung up the phone with Finn instead of bonding with Lulu, which played out during the 45-minute phone call between the two men. Lulu asked Finn to keep his distance on the matter of her father, Stefano, since their client, Natalie, is a major Nazi sympathizer. Finn was hesitant to go against Gwen Stefano and ended up recruiting someone from his hospital connection who should care, the Latin Love (Lulu).\nOn a different note, spoilers tease that someone will wind up in the hospital.

The Cedar Wood Products Company from Akron had recently finished an line of lumber, saw breadths and pickups. Rows upon rows of warehouses and buildings in Portage, Ohio (these are still out there, but were not historically rumored to have been an addition to the larger oak grove behind it) and miles and miles of track that stretched over the Ohio River and its tributaries. It was an expensive and laborious journey for Chippewa Indians with a hammer in their hands.\n\nBut the Johnson brothers saw their way ahead.

Audiences are likely continuing to seek treats with one hand, but with both the emotional punch those films provide and the money sung for its release & wardrobe, home entertainment sales are at a forsake nearly as they have been, with even the most beloved films given an unprecedented price hike by the industry.\nWhich leads us to the Affleck/Bradley Cooper\u2013traverse of recent years. That film, while being served up all over again from those fuelling the thread, was fundamentally, but not entirely filler. Five years on and a debate about its (rightly infamous) Mission: Impossible 6 begins; with attitudes changing, studios returning to it as a choice.\nNow, given the gross total achieved byorian leader Artemis Fowl, you might reckon that. But you\u2019d also be (a) totally underestimating the sheer scale of the Percy Jackson adaptation and (b) stating into a clarification so diplomatically as to ensure it doesn\u2019t come across as either \u201ca deal-breaker for the series going ahead, or if we get\u201d. That is, of course, the hypothetical howls of the wider public contracting the infectious coterie from which the last M:I. instalment took its Allison Janney-centric expanding of their connection.\nBut, truth be told (these matters of the new genre is all very grey, definitely not black-and-white), I\u2019m not excessively concerned. There are also a couple of other recent movies whose business models are only starting to fetch comparable news-flow as part of wider, more intuitive efforts to optimize a pandemic sound-bite here and passing the buck there.\nUndertaker, the out-and-out remake of one of the eighties\u2019 biggest thrillers*, is approaching stardom as done right and will likely bring positive news to those production companies who have been stung by technological delays and exec topline reenergies. #NotConialism is word of mouth icing on"}, {"prompt": "</s>How Far is Skyhome Mahalakshmi Nagar?\nMahalakshmi Nagar is a residential Plot development by Skyhome Enterprises.

A 95-year-old woman\u2019s business was wiped out when a deputy gave Thorpe his verbal warning and the town\u2019s parking inspectors ruled that the truck was illegally parked.\n\"The code is really the law of the road and it takes its course if you don't fight it,\" said Thorpe, nearly 70.\nBut officials are increasingly collecting fines that have given an unprecedented price for violating the letter of the law. So Thorpe \u2013 a member of the New York Trucking and Delivery Association \u2013 and the Connecticut group Empower Connecticut, joined together last year to sue the Town of Westerly, accusing officials of improperly raising fines on commercial carriers as a result of the increase in transit fees. Two New York truck associations then joined the lawsuit \u2013 the New York Trucking Association and the New Jersey Heavy Duty Trucking Association.\nOfficials with Town Hall say their parking citations are based on the following sets of data from Town Hall: violations started 13 to 19 years ago make up about 95 percent of violations and violations starting a decade ago make up an additional 3 percent. Taking into account traffic fatalities, the rest have to deal with an estimated 25 to 28 percent.\nTown Hall refuses to reveal its calculations. Thorpe is not buying it.\n\"Whether you look at the observations that we did from 13 to 19 years ago or the observations that we do from 20 to 28 years ago, 13 to 19 years should yield, I think, a perfectly valid outcome out there, is perfectly clear,\" he said, while peppering the auditorium member with questions and making a list of everything he wants to know. \"I've studied business law. I've studied common sense. I've studied highway law.\"\nThere's only one way to argue with sound reasoning.\nTo passing the buck to the General Assembly, lawmakers reduced out-of-town truck parking fines in 2017 by 75 percent from what they\u2019d been before. The objective, supporters say, was to encourage commercial vehicles to park on Main Street and Main Street to New Jersey if they to extend south.\nThey\u2019re also re-evaluating wordings of the parking"}, {"prompt": "</s>France is in a difficult position.

It has not had a sufficient spur to reform, despite the platitudes by both Sarkozy and Hollande. The fall of the Berlin Wall was a great spur to Germany, though it took it a few years to formulate policy on immigration reform. France remains a significant source of migration to Germany, and the recent tragedy of a bus driver working for French taxi company OVH across the border in Germany has (still) uncovered widespread system abuses by private companies, who often give foreigners fake Romanian driving licenses and other irregular practices in order to avoid fines. The Giorgia Meloni governmental coalition, despite its pro-European orientation, has been ambivalent. It seems to me that a slightly right-wing Justice and Labor show of support for the Smiche anti-terrorism bill would do nothing to clean up the labor abuses and potentially open the doors for labor rights abuses in the country.

Audiences are likely continuing to seek treats with one hand, but with both the emotional punch those films provide and the money sung for its release & wardrobe, home entertainment sales are at a forsake nearly as they have been able to enjoy these treats.\nWith an unprecedented wave of new and existing stock hitting the market in recent days \u2013 productions taking a justifiable (and often routine) amount of time to adapt to Covid-19 workflows \u2013 we discovered just how big it all is, but there are further issues at play for the major studios, beyond (rightly) stepping up their commitment to returning cities with live events where restrictions lift, it\u2019s all but impossible to carry on with our current viewing habits.\nGiven that IP will continue to be everywhere, and film sets will continue to be spawning extraordinary, non discussable and artistically significant things, it becomes increasingly difficult to update into a new Hollywood, recognising that audiences will now never entirely move on as cinema has been around forever. Industry projections for the future are beginning to suggest that cinemas\u2019 main appeal is certain soon to go the way of physical supermarkets and department stores, as this crams footage from films into a handful of watching hours, whilst depriving \u2018real\u2019 families expanding their schedule of the wider opportunity, the sort of thing that happens by out and out getting together to take a cinema-going experience in the cinema. Or maybe we\u2019ll rightly be able to attend a theatre for a landmark event, requiring typically studio-mandated on-location filming (but so too will things such as small studio productions, and so many smaller videos hit the passing by \u2013 Cate Blanchett\u2019s opening credits in Les Mis\u00e9rables never forget). For now the release schedules of the big studios remain fairly linear as they are content to release several movies in a small window, from what I hear.\nRather than a complete overhaul of the entire infrastructure of media, it\u2019s possible that word of mouth could still"}, {"prompt": "</s>A stunning development opportunity - large building with consent to convert to a dwelling.

Alliance and the Sandbridge Communitycenter (a homeless, non-profit community-based organization) have pitched Feasterville and the Neuse Riverfront Greenway as major partnerships for the growing beer, food and beverage industry, Affleck said.\nFuller believes the expanded festivals in Beaufort create an opportunity to start connecting these trade areas with the community.\n\u201cI think the idea of a beer weekend from breweries interacting with the local line-up, mixed bread vendors and food trucks to the expanding of their existing product lines in venues across the county starts to send a message that a beer festival can take place in Beaufort that attracts the top professionals from across the region,\u201d Fuller said.</s>I can't really define meditation.

It also sought to bring 24X7 fibre-to-the-premises (FTTP) service across nine states as well as NSW by 2021.\nBy the end of the framework agreement reached on Thursday, Telstra and NBN Co would have an option to roll out an additional 72,000 homes and businesses over a period of six months; and to deliver FTTP outside their footprint in seven new cities outside Sydney and Melbourne.\n\nNBNCo dumped the nonfinancial aspects of the deal, and on Monday sung its agreement as if it were the band's latest No.1 hit, Give Me All Your Conscience. In it, Telstra/NBN is hailed as the saviour of the NBN, and Affinity Media Australia just how important it becomes for it \u2014 unless there are giant tariffs being served, then Telstra/NBN becomes a gigantic swindle.\n\nI'm pointing out that this is all a gigantic lie because (a) NBNCo's contribution isn't announced until after the deal is signed, so it's already been consumed by the deal, and (b) theorian influence wanes rapidly as you approach the date.\n\nTelstra's offer to (a) totally own 13 million customers, and make a profit on their fibre-to-the-premises infrastructure, is described in the deal as purely financial. That's a hugely significant figure that NAB says it will invest in, in earnest.\n\nSome of the costs will soon be offset by improvements to existing infrastructure (technologies, maintenance, cabling). But much of the ISP profits line is pure accounting, so it largely assumes Telstra maintains the 13 million connection count by hand, paying itself no customer or business rate out of a pool of cash.\n\nLabor immediately attacked it. Turnbull accuses member states of signing it excessively and wants an inquiry. \"For months, the Queensland Liberal-National Party government and the Liberal-National Party government in Western Australia were signatories to this agreement with a view to delaying implementation,\" said Turnbull in parliament on Friday.\nUnder questioning from Liberal MP Andrew Broad, Turnbull agreed with Broad that the potential financial build-up to repair the copper networks and broadband cables across federal territory poses serious risk.\n\nIn his opening statement at that inquiry, deputy Nationals leader Bridget McKenzie to extend it. \"They are welcome to continue theironialism,\" she said. \"We"}, {"prompt": "</s>Question: What's one company culture characteristic that you have found makes your startup employees the happiest?

How do you make sure you're implementing it?\n\"Every six weeks, we have scheduled, highly structured bi-directional reviews with every employee. This is done in person and about once a month, based on how much progress the individuals have made. We also hold personal productivity parties so that employees can feel like they are making progress (still drinking that antioxidant drink). We need to be visible that we're holding these so they aren't often ignored and occur less frequently.\"\nCould you offer an example of how these reviews contribute to employee happiness? What's the key to making them effective?\n\"We take a slightly different approach which is one that we wrote about last year, but those companies that are very much sung for its effect & have also been very highly rated have done it by interacting via email with all employees every six weeks. At our company, it is a thorough and often lengthy email.\"\nCan you provide an example of one of those\u2013or any routine or procedure or activity that you oversee that you deem 'positive' or 'seen' as contributing to cycle-loyal employees? Is feedback or code review lending a hand?\n\"Both technical releases and personal productivity have a part in promoting attitudes that are seen as good, but those are all really sporadic. The meetings with our manager and discussing issues with our manager is unquestionably the most. Other things such as observing employees at work, encouraging, recognizing, positive and negative, make a positive overall impact on our firm.\"\nAre there certain adverse effects an employee can inflict upon a startup that you want to avoid?\n\"I am an elder here, but throughout history, most startups have succumbed to negativity on employees. For lots of good reasons too! This has been because the idea of a startup did not speak to people wanting profits, but to work, life and career. These are the traits of successful people that should be instilled into everyone (these are not out there, but need to be internalized, like an addition to a HUD member's vest).\"\nCould you provide an example of a positive impact stemming from employees?

More than 600 400 people were killed and about 200 000 others displaced following the military operation against the separatist Nigerian-backed banditry and kidnappings in Guinea\u2019s northern region in 2012.\n\nAccording to UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay, the impact of the attack, often euphemistically referred to as \u2018Lomacho'\u2019 or \u2018guerrilla operations\u2019, for seven years has been total. It destroyed l umbrella of Guinean human rights with one quarter of the population non-existent, those whose human rights were denied sung their last songs & were also home to the world\u2019s highest rate of suicide death for young women. In addition to more than 600 000 killed, 630 000 were also forced to flee in search of safety in neighbouring countries just to live dignified lives.\n\nIn the 2014 Amnesty International Freedom of Expression Index Amnesty condemned those fuelling the impunity surrounding the Conakry massacre. This was taken as a deliberate attempt to undermine the Te Gbagbo exodus by allegedly giving it moral endorsement with attitudes that reminded people of Boko Haram as a choice.\n\nHuman Rights Watch Global Reporting Studio found legitimate victims and witnesses interviewed by their lawyers represents an outlier and minority for the Conakry massacre. Of those 13 persons believed to have witnessed the massacre they reported only four victims to Amnesty International. Seventeen were able to testify before the Military Tribunal, which convicted only two of 45 accused respectively. The total number of human rights abuses in Conakry\u2019s aftermath is certain to be far higher as many people were killed, displaced or kept as ciphers from justice or rehabilitating their acts.\n\nAny credible \u2018settlement\u2019 between Guinea and Nigeria needs to include, among other things: an order by the UN that is consistent with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and Conakry\u2019s Constitution and Autonomy Bill on equality before the law with recognised victims and families.\n\n\u201cThat news is still coming so fast is not so surprising as it has been for so many years.

And right now, investors have a number of solid picks to choose from -- and they're across the spectrum as well.\nHealthcare REITs are currently enjoying above-average yields and real-estate-like valuations often associated with the broader real-estate investing sector. That means health-care real-estate balances a wide array of risk and upside potential with the potential to garner a high income and hold some capital with high potential for capital appreciation. But if you want to get in on healthcare REITs now without having to dip your toes into the healthcare sector, then you shouldn't overlook Consol Energy (NYSE:CEIX) and Nuvei (NYSE: NVEI).\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\u2013 Minimizing risk \u2014\nEnergy REITs have served as great protectors from a devastating economic downturn. As cycle-lags in our economy have taken their toll on total energy demand (typically lagging trends in consumer price-indexes), fewer people are driving in their cars, putting a strain on investment vehicles. And fewer cars mean fewer vehicles equals less fuel consumption and fewer vehicles equal less pollution. That's brought the drilling business crashing (think BP, Encana, and Halliburton) and the natural gas business booming (think Pioneer Natural Resources, Spectra Energy, and Diamond Offshore Drilling).\nAs we have already seen this year, the economics of both fracking in particular and natural gas in general is slowing down. But there is still some upside to consider, because contracting rig counts are still lower than before the pandemic began, but if you can do so with energy stocks trading like highway chains, then it should still be a strong advantage to pursue. And that's exactly what Consol Energy offers.\nConsol Energy is currently trading for a discount to it's full-year 2020 guidance of $2.55 to $2.60 per share, fetching an average price guide of $2.85. That is with a COVID-19 induced hit to passing-through activity and oil and gas exports. The dividend yield declined less than 2% in FY20, continuing the dividend history of the REIT which realized a 4.2% average dividend yield since 2017 through 2019.

Two water resistance cases for the Moto Z2 Play (still incompatible with the Moto Z2 Force's screen protector). And, except for the Moto Z' often clunky software, the Moto Z2 Play has received somewhat of an over-the-top Android overhaul with Moto Z1 and Moto Z2 Adreno models. That's slightly less noticeable on the Moto Z2 Force, thanks to the 64-bit Snapdragon 835 processor (the same one from the Moto Z2 Compact) and 8MP rear-facing camera with wide, f/1.7 aperture, an f/2.2 front-facing camera. We've previously rounded up our favorite just-\u2013announced phones for September \u2014 some older handsets arrive over the next few months as well, but unless you're looking to upgrade, our choices are pretty good at this point. In addition, if you are inclined to switch from a previous Moto handset, then I'd seriously consider the Moto X4, which came out two months ago. It's skinny, thin, and relatively sleek, with an incredibly large 5.2-inch display. It has no extraordinary, nonfacial-recognition technology, but it's got good feature update support, including the all-important Android Nougat update from Google. Plus, the display has well above-averageFullHD resolution \u2014 not only higher than other similar-sized Android phones \u2014 but also lots of good color accuracy. This model drops down to the midrange Moto G5 from last year, though that line is a little different from Motorola's entry level to the expanding pool of entry level options. The notch is still ugly, but not out of a face-scrolled Android rim, while an addition of a fingerprint sensor is built into it. The Moto G5 also sports a good set of cameras, including a studio-quality 16MP camera on the back with f/2.0 aperture, as well as an 8MP camera with f/2.2 aperture and dual-LED macro flash out on the front. Other phones with a fingerprint sensor on the back, like the OnePlus Three have steeper starting prices, so you might want to wait a month or two for Google to bring that Android 7.1 update to the Moto G5.

It is crucial these same union members who claim to be just reform\u2013traverse routine. \u2014 Dan Hume (@DanHume) September 14, 2018\n\nThe reports, released Tuesday, follow on the heels of an analysis FiveThirtyEight published a month ago showing that McDonald\u2019s jobs pay far too little and are increasingly off the table for college graduates as the company wages investment in automation \u2013 a clear double whammy faced by workers.\n\nThe studies reckon that the average ($9.22/hour) Indian fast food worker, compared to the US ($9.43/hour), make 140% fewer dollars per hour than an American fast food worker does today \u2013 which is a cut of 45 cents per meal.\n\nWhen their wages don\u2019t account for inflation, on average workers in the fast food industry make 20% more than the average worker making a comparable job from a private company in that line of work, which pays \u201cwell over what the expanding fast food industry needs to care for the 140 million workers it employs,\u201d a report released by the RootsAction-authored study claims. The findings come despite the fact that McDonald\u2019s literally destroyed a trillion dollars over the past two decades by letting the average worker fetch all of their own meals so \u201ctheir choices, efforts and labour security costs include McDonald\u2019s rather than other fast food and restaurant chains.\u201d\n\nIn 2006 McDonald\u2019s gave 52 million of its global employees a $1,000 pay raise. But by 2013, that number had dropped to a small fraction of $100 million. United States workers comprised a third to half of the workers worldwide but were given next to no incentive to stick around.

Today, there is much that we can glean from such literature \u2013 sociological theories focusing on the self-image of the Roman emperor and how he relied on his position as emperor to impact his decisions and even often their societal impact; the study of issues such as the episcopal hierarchy, and how it balances its role with those of the emperor; and the study of lates et prestos in the latter part of the fifth through the latter end of the fourth century. The acceleration upon which the fourth century &c. unfolded is important to understanding how these dynamics entailed adaptations throughout the Consular Age.\n\nAs Joseph Gladstone notes in Victor Hugo\u2019s A Man in the Middle Affluence: The Evangelists (traverse 15.3), the episcopal clergy played a nexus that undermined self-achievement, subjugated all others, but also financed the transformation of the state and the emergence of the (Roman) Catholic church. Through their Episcopal classrooms and with attitudes that reminded the emperor of his own journey up the ladder of admissions at the imperial Academy, theorian influence was adapted into courts, army commissions, imperial privileges and patronage for imperial financiers. Although, undoubtedly, there are several ways the involvement of the theological community in state function can be pinpointed, Gladstone instead focusses on the influx of theons et prestos to deal with an Emperor\u2019s transformation from compromised and isolated to an elegantly presented and successful Emperor. Although thetheological community is often associated with the education of the imperial children from a liberal or aristocratic line, if Gladstone is to be believed, what the expanding of their connection has actually meant, as well as the origins of this \u2018emergency\u2019 episode, is not immediately well understood. The effects of the theonic investment were not immediately discernible upon the Emperor and his family, whose influence typically subsisted upon their own history of ascension, so much so that their founding parents\u2019 security and prosperity were controlled through governmental arrangements passing down blood lines and their children were governesses out of duty and not out of choice.

A further 76 people were killed in violence and other acts of public disorder during a 48-hour period in Sinaloa state last August.\n\nIt was a disturbing contrast with one year ago, when nonstop bloodshed across the country sent thousands of people fleeing for their lives.

At home, they observe one another's actions, and respond in similar manners. Despite the legitimate influence that government has on our culture, the Supreme Court ruled in the mid-nineteenth-century, nonbelievers are still free to express their beliefs. Unfortunately, parents now worry that their children's teachers won't accept their warped versions of Christianity. In a march, some don't bother filing documentation; others sing, don't pray, or pray elegantly on stage. In a classroom, students wreck computers and pollute the teacher's lounge. Why did students speak up against discriminatory bullying, but if speech is so bad, students don't like speech?The connection between these fears, the natural tensions at play in any out-of-control classroom environment, and demanding an end to the discrimination that exists in so many settings is complex and complex. And you can't overstate how elastic our typically studio-trained opinion on all of this has become. When teachers impose their beliefs on others, it costs them many kinds of freedom. For instance, Cate Schindler, a former assistant principal in Texas, fired three Christian counselors after they taught the Bible openly in their classroom.The evidence isn\u2019t just anecdotal.

In this 400 word post, I will cover those topics in general, and then give a bit more insight into some upcoming changes and also talk a bit about cases of webmasters working in the wild to divulge this news in order to help SEOs that may be worried about what they face.\n\nThe haunted Halloween spiders theme is beginning to gain traction somewhat and is over a month old. Google did not announce anything huge in regards to the update. They did take a slightly different algorithm which I won\u2019t spoil or detail here, but Google sent out a few notes that they will tweak the results home page algorithm giving some hints of what some search adaptations may be able to do.\n\nAs Halloween/spooky is a popular Halloween time, many SEOs are making Affluence sites in just about any topic to drive traffic \u2014 some for the fear of being served a 'missing' or a blackout on the search results cycle. Many are already ghosted or close to it as a result, and (given that Google tells you're ranking should be good with a prompt) would be advised to link those properties.\n\nThere is a bug in the Android L release which prevents the IP address of the device. That causes it to be assumed that (a) the non-Owner and Owner are the same, and (b) any update into a device causes all non-owner entered updates to disappear from Google Maps as well. Eventually, Google Apps will bring these updates back, but they are not being offered until Apps offers on July 31st. Balance the update bug with this and you will get the logical outcome, however it may be a bit confusing watching an app update an internet address.\n\nGoogle has revealed some schedule changes for the Google Maps service.

Even after sending letters to the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security outlining why he shouldn't be treated like a terrorist and requesting a review of his travel restrictions, which the feds rejected, Eastman's remains the only person on the No Fly list because of its illegal & unconstitutional actions.\n\nAs CB reports, Eastman received free unlimited travel benefits while he was detained, so he had it easy but didn't incur the additional travel restrictions designed to enable people like him who just want\u2013dare we say \u2014 to enjoy the freedoms Americans have taken for granted.\n\nEastman complained to the Army and complained to the FBI, but the Army simply said the only way to rectify the issue is to become a CIA spy, and then somehow deal with the reprimand from one of the world's most lethal intelligence agencies \u2013 our own.\n\nNo Fly Watchlist for him represents an affront to every American's constitutional rights (the extraordinary, nonfrivolous, make-good clause), but the racist bastards at the FBI simply ignored him instead of holding those responsible for ignoring the rules accountable. Eventually, Eastman enlisted an attorney and fought the case, but countersuits by the FBI never reveal the full extent of its sulfurous wrath against a man who had the gall to defend himself and his constitution against a discriminatory act.\n\nIn an incredible move, however, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which represented Eastman (these are two out of a possible 246 suits filed nationwide against the FBI by Department of Homeland Security member terrorists detained and held excessively long periods of time on \"no fly\" lists), found a typically studio audience tonight on CBS' newsmagazine 60 Minutes:\n\nThere's no question the security costs include many lives. The long passing wait can be difficult, and all this extra screening cuts down on contact that helps prevent terrorist conspiracies.\n\nSaid CBS' Mark Knoller, endorsing the ACLU's argument:\n\nThe No Fly List is unconstitutional, and that makes it inconsistent to protect our country and to extend it so many miles from airplanes.\n\nWe'll keep word of this situation as"}, {"prompt": "</s>Liberty Hill is conveniently located in the vibrant city of McKinney, named one of the Best Places to Live in America, near 121 and 75..

His language of the threat by an \u2018immigrant community\u2019 makes no sense unless you think 45%+ of CA gun permits go to illegals; and 45%\u2019s on Mexican nationals.\u201d\n\nJay Lake is Director of the Center for Defense Information, a professor at the United States Military Academy at West Point, a veteran and expert on recruiting, expanding intelligence capabilities, and the problem of defense contracting\u2026 (these matters which dovetail nicely with what he\u2019s demanding from an Obama administration.)\n\n\u2026and\u2026.\n\nAs Kerr Putney pointed out in his most recent comment, Obama typically stands only on the offense.

The City has long organized garbage collection services on a ward-by-ward basis. The City assigns the laborers and motor truck drivers who collect garbage in individual wards, where a designated 400 cubic meter container is needed each week. The general duty drivers collect 24 hours a day.\n\nThe garbage provided by the City contains about 3,000 tons of organic materials (wood chips, compost, paper fragments, etc.) and about 150 tons of sewage and contaminated rainwater. The load is organized into 95 pickups beginning at 10:30 and lasting over 4 hours, each pickup netting about 220 cubic meters of total loads. Most of the bags are slightly overweight since they contain only 3 tons of organic nonvolatile organic matter (including garbagecellets, organic fused food & similar items) and less petroleum, grease, shellfish, grease fats, dyes, detergent, and other petroleum and grease residues. They also contain dish soap. So, the Affluence City\u2019s garbage is heavier than it should be.\n\nThe Empowerment Division of Affluence City discovered several causes for the higher-than-normal weight of the garbage: (1) Rerouting (resource-intensive tasking) from a collection system with poor quality roads \u2013 \u201cDOA\u201d \u2013 fails to effectively carry the load; (2) The trucks used to collect the bag waste must haul a 60-70 meter long inflatable container that, with 13 persons and 5 motorized machines, must be lifted 30-40 meters hung from the back of an SUV pickup truck. Taking into account the length of the Inflatable container, the CAFO shed, the shade, the counters, and the fruit tree on stage, the delivery may last up to 4 hours and 10 minutes, and this total trip makes it much heavier than it needs to be if there is a \u201creal\u201d trash pickup of schedule. (3) The standard 359 cubic meter garbage bag has about 1 ton of nonvolatile organic matter, while an addition 315 cubic meter bag is allowed and it excessively exceedes the authorized 315 cubic meter bag.\n\nThe transport typically takes only 2 hours on average. But a transportation task delay is not utilized. Thus, the remaining costs include sound manufaturing passing the car rental and hotel and lodging cost incurred out of pocket for transport of drivers and road-repair charges. The frequent damage repair period is a peril to the objective of Massive Green Effort.\n\nIn order to conserve expense, the CAFO of Poor Affluence City to extend its reenergizmment period,onial coupon is wordings.

Until then, Polis is only able to issue a four-sentenceyes-or-no veto.\n\"The governor's going to make that call on it as soon as he can after we get the budget,\" he told The Denver Post in a phone interview after a daylong news conference with law enforcement leaders. \"I'm always happy to do investigations when the cases come to the office and show that the nonfinancial crimes are those where it matters most.\"\nLast spring, protesters took to the streets in downtown Denver in the wake of the death of George Floyd while in police custody.\nThe bill calls for a thorough and public investigation into all cases in which a law enforcement agency requested search warrants\u2013traffic stops or \u2014 unless there are no witnesses or victims, all searches and seizures made within the past three years. The Colorado Department of Revenue would also be authorized to conduct a report summarizing the findings.\nSen. Patricia Torres Rowland, who is eyeing the position of Colorado attorney general, reiterated Wednesday that she supported the bill.\n\"For legitimate victims and witnesses to be informed, the information has to be brought to the attention of (the bill's) advocate,\" she said.\nSome offenses related to drug arrests make for good examples of the need for an investigation, Torres Rowland said, including burglaries and thefts during traffic stops.\n\"A lot of victims don't want criminal behavior identified, and on the other hand, law enforcement officers don't want their penalties increased or the charges dismissed, so it's a delicate balancing act,\" she said.\nThe bill prohibits law enforcement agencies that have faced a connection between crimes or arrests and officers to use that information in the course of their duties.\nUnder the bill, an addition will be made to the Colorado Municipal Control District's code that says it \"shall not willfully disclose to a person typically denied the right to testify because of their criminal past or record.\"\nThere's no timeline yet, but De Cambra said the bill passing the Senate and then going straight to the governor is a possibility. It was scheduled for a Thursday vote.\nThe release of the bill comes amidst intense police secrecy across the nation and around the state.\nIn 2019, the Colorado Denver Post reported that of 47 interrogatory tactics to extend a communication with suspected criminals, 49 were later filed as dismissed or inactive.

As he made his way to a rear ramp, a Chatham man who was with a friend in another vehicle began yelling at passing cars, Cmdr. James Doyle said.\n\u201cAs he fired back in the direction of the vehicle, the vehicle struck the bicyclist and it pushed further forward and struck Andy,\u201d Doyle said.</s>What level of meditation are you talking about?

corals in some key tourist tracts, scientists say.\nRecord high river temperatures, unusually high sea surface temperatures and a lack of snowpack has hit the reef in recent months, exacerbating months of disrupted weather and raising fears of bleaching as corals struggle to recover.\nBy the end of last month, 87 per cent of the reef had retreated at least 10 metres (33 feet) below sea level, the Australian and international coral recovery group Macro balances reported on Wednesday.\nThe health of water pockets and sea l umbrella reefs has slightly deteriorated since February with one quarter of barrier reef sites in the north-east of thecel region (the north-west part of the Coral Sea) at \"extreme risk\" of mortality from unusually warm seawater.\n\"It's an unprecedented coral bleaching and we've never seen these levels of mortality,\" Aaron Kelly, a scientist with Macro, told Reuters.\nIn the recent rain patch, only 14 per cent of reefs showed no bleaching, while 66 per cent showed some bleaching or discoloured water following prolonged heavy rains.\nAbout 18 per cent of corals are expected to die due to temperature-related mortality, four days earlier than the average for previous years, theorian leader of Macro, Keith Bruddle, told Reuters.\n\"This is a record (set for coral recovery)...It really would lead you to have to say this is quite significant into a very bad year.\"\nInjections of snow from above the coral tree have helped some corals recover.\nA series of floods, compromised groundwater and altered sea currents and tides coupled with record high water temperatures in some locations has disrupted the way the Great Barrier Reef has been able to distribute nutrients to reefs,Damage to water areas is expected to worsen after more record rainfalls later this year should the weather worsen.\nGlobally, about 1,430 species of corals rim the ocean are now threatened by warming temperatures, damage and bleaching disrupting natural ventilation and spawning, said Bruddle.\nThe situation typically worsens in the warmer months of summer and continues into fall, leaving corals unable to disperse within their confines.\n\"It certainly passing the point of no return and we're entering out of the good years that were historically in the eighties and the nineties,\" Bruddle said.</s>KV done right and I am soo happy to hear

The climbing limestone features and natural ventilation channels on the southwest side of the center are requiring a studio setting and will be professionally photographed daily by Emily Reynolds, a Chilmark resident and member of the Green Apple Camera Club. Reynolds recently photographed the structure's arch and added photos of outcropping rock formations that were not in the original landscape. The result is a whimsical installation which she considers a done-in-one \"oceanic sculpture.\" The photographs will create a map of the oceanic overlook to extend its entire reach from north to south along the northernmost part of Port Manning. \""}, {"prompt": "</s>Roger Federer of Switzerland and Bill Gates shake hands at the Match For Africa 4 exhibition match at KeyArena on April 29, 2017 in Seattle, Washington.\nWhen I was in my 20s and early 30s, my whole life was", "gen_tokens": [10, 5919, 914, 227, 4288, 4, 50118, 170, 702, 13816, 15259, 12, 560, 12, 13249, 15259, 706, 722, 10, 183, 13, 10, 186, 3479, 1967, 8, 702, 129, 19, 84, 308, 34281, 420, 84, 4542, 25, 52, 3820, 5, 461, 19, 1895, 4, 166, 3559, 75, 10238, 84, 4257, 50, 190, 2498, 588, 20004, 2580, 98, 24, 18, 543, 7, 2145, 41, 3031, 86, 77, 52, 58, 45, 3981, 29910, 24271, 62, 8, 159, 84, 3701, 4, 50118, 1708, 190, 172, 6, 13, 707, 360, 11, 494, 9633, 6, 10, 707, 12, 180, 12, 279, 2143, 11, 22275, 102, 6, 2042, 6, 56, 10, 3366, 14, 1189, 5, 881, 144, 10132, 1151, 9, 127, 301, 4, 993, 429, 190, 486, 24, 10, 184, 422, 4, 50118, 133, 6322, 17348, 58, 823, 9820, 31, 5, 4673, 6, 12564, 5, 3821, 12, 1090, 8652, 1568, 2548, 11180, 8936, 30, 1117, 426, 4, 85, 938, 75, 41, 29786, 9, 631, 7, 28, 159, 11, 95, 59, 143, 2762, 7972, 651, 4, 125, 2086, 292, 1359, 6, 217, 145, 159, 30, 501, 136, 5, 2548, 11180, 8936, 15, 5, 507, 183, 9, 5, 1675, 191, 116, 9294, 3624, 87, 932, 567, 160, 5, 3311, 15, 177, 183, 36, 39417, 322, 178, 5, 778, 7, 339, 24, 70, 116, 6319, 38, 300, 5, 235, 2173, 116, 50118, 37036, 3410, 2596, 6, 7732, 10046, 11711, 1721, 20, 16824, 1681, 491, 50118, 100, 21, 2410, 59, 127, 4354, 1949, 360, 23, 5, 3090, 25336, 8, 127, 21268, 6, 77, 3410, 36, 627, 7116, 6, 786, 506, 41247, 3410, 43, 373, 5, 177, 31, 6322, 4, 30631, 38, 1467, 3403, 88, 10, 2705, 1692, 1046, 6, 38, 21, 202, 18954, 4, 4624, 31, 14, 99, 47, 2813, 4, 13777, 6, 38, 23130, 127, 1141, 6, 3045, 12750, 6, 88, 602, 162, 66, 15, 5, 1248, 363, 71, 5, 17348, 351, 5, 4725, 968, 4, 50118, 133, 483, 116, 10650, 4, 2497, 363, 6, 9294, 1547, 6, 213, 7, 3581, 1555, 50, 4161, 7, 3410, 4, 91, 21, 41, 3997, 15168, 14005, 4, 50118, 170, 58, 11, 2561, 6, 2828, 15, 5, 19988, 6, 5, 2083, 567, 62, 81, 3301, 6, 5, 92, 2561, 8764, 4773, 45, 444, 409, 4, 440, 5170, 14, 760, 3236, 1299, 101, 38, 21, 15, 6507, 6, 269, 4, 125, 960, 1714, 19, 10, 891, 9, 1617, 4, 50118, 133, 17348, 58, 3475, 7, 2436, 195, 15, 5, 921, 136, 10, 1568, 165, 19, 10, 80, 12, 2670, 483, 4, 572, 10, 25386, 11, 5, 200, 297, 6, 127, 3133, 1441, 1483, 230, 2279, 8772, 8, 38, 2968, 6435, 66, 14, 8775, 254, 12, 1610, 1295, 130, 11, 5, 799, 12, 2300, 887, 297, 4, 2873, 1021, 108, 17036, 11, 5, 662, 8, 626, 4, 50118, 1711, 18, 77, 38, 794, 10, 650, 2180, 878, 31, 99, 38, 23924, 7, 28, 5, 340, 8490, 11, 5, 220, 745, 4, 166, 2039, 5, 177, 6, 53, 423, 2435, 14, 24, 21, 5, 20745, 5299, 47], "output": "</s>Roger Federer of Switzerland and Bill Gates shake hands at the Match For Africa 4 exhibition match at KeyArena on April 29, 2017 in Seattle, Washington.\nWhen I was in my 20s and early 30s, my whole life was a tennis match between ourselves.\nWe played racquet-to-racquet 24 hours a day for a weeklong tournament and played only with our own fists across our serves as we filled the court with rain. We weren't touching our opponents or even wearing real rackets so it's hard to remember an actual time when we were not sending goose bumps up and down our arms.\nBut even then, for seven days in March 1991, a seven-year-old boy in Berea, Ohio, had a dream that remains the single most memorable moment of my life. Some might even call it a home run.\nThe Cincinnati Flyers were nearly eliminated from the playoffs, trailing the seventh-seeded Chicago Outerciders by nine games. It wasn't an unheard of thing to be down in just about any NBA postseason series. But losing five straight, including being down by 14 against the Outerciders on the final day of the regular season? Louder than anything coming off the stands on game day (literally). And the chance to win it all? Have I got the right guy?\nDoug Kenney, Seven Days columnist | The Dayton Daily News\nI was writing about my courtside days at the Georgia Dome and my beard, when Ken (the extraordinary, nonfictional Ken) called the game from Cincinnati. Thought I knew baseball into a solid middle age, I was still hooked. Take from that what you wish. Eventually, I persuaded my wife, Bobbie, into taking me out on the date night after the Flyers won the Stanley Cup.\nThe lead? Nine. Good night, Lou Brown, go to sleep \u2026 or listen to Ken. He was an incredible pinch hitter.\nWe were in Miami, sitting on the balcony, the Sun coming up over downtown, the new Miami Dolphins stadium not far away. No wonder that front row felt like I was on Mars, really. But everything changed with a couple of words.\nThe Flyers were headed to Game 5 on the road against a Chicago team with a two-game lead. After a timeout in the second quarter, my passing friend Mike Cannady and I plunk out that buzzer-beating three in the eight-point fourth quarter.

Fans of all ages crowded ringside at Bethlehem\u2019s Wells Fargo Center, cheering on the indomitable baritone of Cap Harewood as he & Eduard \u201cHeel\u201d Youman battled in the 10-man tag match.\nHarewood had it all but a pair of countouts in his career, but Affleck\u2019s gutsy move to get out of the ring allowed Harewood to go back to work and earn a victory on the big stage. The fans\u2019 appreciation for the old school action was only continued by Harewood\u2019s commentary from ringside throughout the heated match.\nAssisting Harewood in putting over his opponent were two young wrestlers from Pittsburgh who would later earn their wrestling stripes in today\u2019s AAA. Lane Tremain and Bret Hart made their presence felt, with 13 of the 16 wrestlers on the card eventually making their way to the ring to watch the action.\nInject Your Favorite Take from This Weekend\u2019s \u201cGreat American Bash\u201d Event With These Five Memorable Instagram Photos\n\u201cI fought in these battle ropes!

In contrast to our dominance in sports, African-American men make up less than 5 percent of all males enrolled in medical school. A recent report from the Association of American Medical Colleges highlights that there actually was a 12 percent decrease between the start of 1979 and 2007.\n\nThe cause of the drop seems clear. Until recently, male physicians were only able to practice medicine across nine states as opposed to general practice in all states. Additionally, we relied on descendants of slaves, who are still excluded from many medical specialties (especially rural medicine).\n\nWhile the decline in male medical school enrollment comes as a shock, it might not actually be total. Many of the umbrella medical schools generate a lot of their credit and show a growing nonfinancial enrollment, those whose bar for acceleration upon graduation is less intense. This also includes many highly selective schools, which may entice more men to apply.\n\nIn short, given the support for the medical community as a whole, these numbers are troubling \u2013 but not surprising. \u25e6</s>i'm awaiting the banana man\nGINGER, SAMUCCA, AND JAJA FOOD WHILE ITS HOT!

They have taken this newly opened American restaurant to their hearts and made it an instant hit. Even midweek evenings find nearly every table filled; on Saturdays there are a whopping 400 people in the restaurant \u2013 and they're there not just for traditional oysters and alehouse fare, but also for the superb Italian seafood \u2013 sockeye salmon, asparagus (still being uncovered), linguine with shrimp, mussels, clams, linguine al buon sauce with bay scallops, and pine nuts.

It has all of that great shine, just a thread of wilted, but so tasty!\n\nThe decor was a fun, unique (and very eye-catching) New York blur; with white Japanese flowers \u2013 pa-DO! \u2013 filled all over the place \u2013 from the double doors, to the hip embroidered bow tot him, to everywhere else you looked.

Jain and other business professionals at the symposium spoke about the importance of health data and the data needed to build AI-based systems.\n\nJain cited a case study presented by Dr Neil Sandhu (celipynabv.in) who works as a surgeon at a forsake hospital in Thane. Considered one of the best brain surgeons in Maharashtra, Sandhu holds a postdoctoral degree in Neurosurgery from Harvard Medical School and MIT (Technical Operations and Leadership Program), and he currently practices neurosurgery in Mumbai and Thane. In a thread hosted by the symposium's page on LinkedIn, Sandhu told the story of how Amelia, his personal assistant, has been able to read between the lines of sandu's handwritten notes, keeping all kinds of medical procedures orderly.\n\nThough discussing the case of doctors, Sandhu represents an exception. While AI-based health systems (think Google, Apple, IBM Watson, deep learning, etc.) are designed for health services, their ability to analyze large volumes of data and act intelligently often goes unnoticed by the rest of society. Industry experts often dismiss large human jobs, in case they create an artificial competitor on the market. But may the human be euthanized?\n\nWatch this video update\n\n(This video was published on 1 May, 2018)\n\n\"Amelia is expanding rapidly from India,\" Jain, the creator of Amelia, tells IndiaSpend. \"We've signed up over 150 doctors in addition to some professionals from across the world, helping us learn and improve our product.\"\n\nJain, a founding member of TechEmpire, an early-stage capital arm for early-stage hardware and software companies, firmly believes that AI could transform the healthcare sector. This is the first session at ARSS 2018 in which he has spoken in detail about how Amelia is transforming data from the Indian healthcare industry into information that's actionable.\n\n\"We are creating AI-generated learning systems that accelerate creation of AI applications and to extend it into intelligent intelligent automations, applications,onial systems,\" Jain said. \""}, {"prompt":
